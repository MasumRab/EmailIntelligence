# Documented Development Sessions with IFLOW.md Integration

## Session Goals

1. **Establish Session Structure**: Create a consistent framework for documenting development activities
2. **Integrate with IFLOW.md**: Ensure all session activities align with iFlow CLI guidelines and project conventions
3. **Track Development Activities**: Maintain detailed logs of all development work for future reference
4. **Facilitate Productive Workflows**: Set up processes that support efficient and effective development

## Session Structure

Following the guidelines in `docs/iflow_development_workflow.md`, each development session should include:

### 1. Session Initialization
- Create a new session log in `backlog/sessions/` with the naming convention `IFLOW-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md`
- Document session goals, context, and initial state
- Update the main `SESSION_LOG.md` with session tracking information

### 2. Task Planning
- Use the iFlow CLI todo system to track tasks
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Prioritize tasks based on project needs

### 3. Implementation
- Follow project conventions as documented in IFLOW.md
- Use appropriate tools for code reading, writing, and modification
- Maintain consistent code style with existing project code

### 4. Documentation
- Document all activities in the session log
- Update relevant documentation files as needed
- Record development priorities and next steps

### 5. Session Closure
- Summarize completed work and outcomes
- Document any remaining tasks for future sessions
- Archive session log appropriately

## IFLOW.md Integration

The iFlow CLI is designed to assist with software engineering tasks in the EmailIntelligence project. For this session, we're establishing the framework for documented development:

### Core Mandates
1. **Conventions**: Rigorously adhere to existing project conventions when reading or modifying code
2. **Libraries/Frameworks**: NEVER assume a library/framework is available without verifying its established usage
3. **Style & Structure**: Follow existing code style and structure strictly
4. **Idiomatic Changes**: Understand local context to ensure changes integrate naturally

### Tools Available
- `read_file`: Read file contents
- `write_file`: Write content to a file
- `replace`: Replace text within a file
- `search_file_content`: Search for patterns in files
- `glob`: Find files matching patterns
- `run_shell_command`: Execute shell commands
- `todo_write`/`todo_read`: Task management

### Workflow Process
1. **Understand**: Analyze the user's request and relevant codebase context
2. **Plan**: Build a coherent plan based on understanding
3. **Implement**: Use available tools to act on the plan
4. **Verify (Tests)**: Run project's testing procedures
5. **Verify (Standards)**: Execute project-specific build, linting and type-checking commands

## Session Expectations

### Documentation Standards
- All development activities should be documented in session logs
- Code changes should follow existing project conventions
- Tasks should be tracked using the iFlow CLI todo system
- Regular updates should be made to session logs during development

### Quality Assurance
- Follow security best practices as outlined in IFLOW.md
- Maintain code quality through proper testing and verification
- Ensure all changes are properly documented
- Adhere to project coding standards

### Collaboration
- Maintain clear communication through session logs
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
- Ensure work is reproducible by other team members
- Follow established project workflows

## Next Steps

1. Continue with planned development tasks
2. Maintain detailed session documentation
3. Update SESSION_LOG.md with session progress
4. Complete all planned activities for this session
5. Ensure proper integration with existing project documentation

This framework will support consistent, high-quality development work while maintaining proper documentation and tracking of all activities.
