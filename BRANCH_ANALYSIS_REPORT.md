## 🎯 Priority Cleanup Recommendations

### 🚨 High Priority (Immediate Action Required)

#### 1. Large Unmerged Feature Branches
```bash
# These branches have significant work that should be evaluated
- feature-dashboard-stats-endpoint (634 commits)
- feature/major-platform-enhancements (623 commits)
- feat/modular-ai-platform (332 commits)
```

#### 2. Major Bugfix Branches
```bash
# Critical fixes that may still be needed
- fix/audit-environment-and-report (383 commits)
- fix/import-errors-and-docs (380 commits)
- bug/bad-merges (486 commits)
```

### ⚠️ Medium Priority (Next Sprint)

#### 3. Documentation Branches
```bash
# Evaluate documentation completeness
- doc-and-setup-fixes-1 (289 commits)
- sqlite (216 commits)
```

#### 4. Testing Branches
```bash
# Ensure test suite stability
- fix-test-suite (276 commits)
```

### ✅ Low Priority (Backlog)

#### 5. Setup & Utility Branches
```bash
# Evaluate ongoing relevance
- gmail-creds-env-var (446 commits)
- alert-autofix-19 (384 commits)
```

## 🛠️ Branch Management Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment (Current)
```bash
# For each unmerged branch, determine:
1. Is the work still relevant?
2. Has the functionality been implemented elsewhere?
3. Are there merge conflicts preventing integration?
4. Should the branch be archived or deleted?
```

### Phase 2: Consolidation
```bash
# For relevant branches:
1. Resolve any merge conflicts
2. Test branch functionality
3. Merge to main or scientific branch
4. Delete merged branches
```

### Phase 3: Archival
```bash
# For outdated branches:
1. Create archive tags if needed
2. Delete obsolete branches
3. Update documentation
```

## 📋 Action Items

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Review 3 high-priority feature branches for merge viability
- [ ] Assess 7 major bugfix branches for current relevance
- [ ] Evaluate documentation branch consolidation needs

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- [x] Clean up testing branches
- [ ] Archive or merge setup/utility branches
- [ ] Update branch naming conventions

### Long-term (Ongoing)
- [ ] Implement branch lifecycle policy
- [ ] Regular branch cleanup reviews
- [ ] Automated branch health monitoring

## 📊 Branch Health Metrics

### Age Distribution
- **Recent (< 1 week):** 13 branches (25.5%)
- **Month (1-4 weeks):** 29 branches (56.9%)
- **Quarter (1-3 months):** 4 branches (7.8%)
- **Old (> 3 months):** 5 branches (9.8%)

### Size Distribution
- **Large (> 500 commits):** 3 branches
- **Medium (200-500 commits):** 15 branches
- **Small (< 200 commits):** 33 branches

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** 3 large unmerged feature branches
- **Medium Risk:** 7 major unmerged bugfix branches
- **Low Risk:** Documentation and testing branches
