## Execution Plan

1. **Create backup branch** to preserve current state
2. **Create a new branch** from the parent commit
3. **Apply changes in logical groups** with clear commit messages
4. **Verify each commit** maintains functionality
5. **Test final result** matches current functionality
6. **Document process** for future reference

## Expected Benefits

1. **Reduced Merge Conflicts** - Smaller, focused commits are less likely to conflict
2. **Improved Reviewability** - Logical grouping makes changes easier to understand
3. **Better Debugging** - If issues arise, they can be traced to specific commits
4. **Enhanced Collaboration** - Clear history enables better teamwork
5. **Simplified Rollback** - Individual features can be reverted without affecting others

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backup Strategy** - Keep current state in backup branch
2. **Incremental Testing** - Test each commit during rebase process
3. **Functionality Preservation** - Ensure all existing features continue to work
4. **Documentation** - Maintain clear records of changes and rationale
5. **Verification Process** - Confirm final result matches current functionality
