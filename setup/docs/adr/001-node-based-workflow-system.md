# ADR 001: Node-Based Workflow System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The EmailIntelligence platform needed a flexible way to process emails through complex, user-defined workflows. Traditional linear processing pipelines were insufficient for the diverse email analysis requirements.

## Decision
Implement a node-based workflow system where users can visually create processing pipelines by connecting nodes in a graph structure.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Flexibility**: Users can create custom processing flows without coding
- **Modularity**: Individual processing steps are reusable components
- **Visual Design**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for workflow creation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new node types for different processing tasks

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Graph-based processing is more complex than linear pipelines
- **Performance**: Potential overhead from graph traversal and node communication
- **Learning Curve**: Users need to understand node-based concepts

### Risks
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Complex graphs may impact processing speed
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Harder to debug issues in graph-based workflows

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **WorkflowEngine**: Orchestrates node execution
- **Node**: Base class for all processing nodes
- **Connection**: Defines data flow between nodes
- **WorkflowValidator**: Ensures workflow integrity

### Node Types
- **Input Nodes**: Email ingestion (Gmail, IMAP, files)
- **Processing Nodes**: Analysis, filtering, categorization
- **Output Nodes**: Storage, notifications, exports

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Linear Pipeline
- **Pros**: Simple, fast, easy to understand
- **Cons**: Limited flexibility, hard to customize

### Option 2: Rule-Based System
- **Pros**: Declarative, business-friendly
- **Cons**: Limited to predefined rule types

### Option 3: Scripting Interface
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility
- **Cons**: Requires programming knowledge
