# Task: Test Subtree Operations and Integration

## Description
Thoroughly test the subtree operations and integration to ensure the setup files can be properly maintained and updated across different branches.

## Steps
1. Test adding new features to the setup subtree
2. Test pulling updates from the subtree to main branch
3. Test pulling updates from the subtree to scientific branch
4. Verify that main and scientific branches can continue to diverge normally
5. Test complete launch process from both branches after subtree integration

## Subtasks
- [ ] Test adding a new feature to setup subtree
- [ ] Test pulling subtree changes to main branch
- [ ] Test pulling subtree changes to scientific branch
- [ ] Verify main and scientific branches still function independently
- [ ] Test complete launch process from main branch
- [ ] Test complete launch process from scientific branch
- [ ] Verify no conflicts arise during normal development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Subtree changes can be made and pulled successfully
- [ ] Main and scientific branches maintain independent functionality
- [ ] Launch process works correctly from both branches
- [ ] No conflicts arise during normal development process
- [ ] Setup files remain synchronized as expected
