# Task: Initialize Git Subtree for Setup Directory

## Description
Initialize the `/setup` directory as a git subtree, potentially using a separate branch or repository for better isolation of setup files.

## Steps
1. Create a dedicated branch for setup files (e.g., `setup-main`)
2. Set up the subtree relationship between the setup branch and the main repository
3. Document the subtree commands for future use
4. Test the subtree functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create `setup-main` branch containing only setup files
- [ ] Set up subtree relationship from main repository
- [ ] Document subtree commands for team use
- [ ] Test pushing and pulling changes to/from subtree
- [ ] Verify setup files can be updated independently

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Setup files exist in a separate branch/remote
- [ ] Subtree relationship established correctly
- [ ] Team can update setup files independently
- [ ] Changes in setup subtree can be pulled into main repository
- [ ] Documentation available for subtree operations
