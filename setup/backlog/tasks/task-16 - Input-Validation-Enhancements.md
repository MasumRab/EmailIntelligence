# Task: Input Validation Enhancements

## Priority
HIGH

## Description
Enhance input validation to improve security and data quality.

## Current Implementation
Pydantic validation for API inputs.

## Requirements
1. Add additional validation layers for business logic
2. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
3. Add input sanitization for stored data
4. Implement security headers and CSP policies

## Acceptance Criteria
- Business logic validation prevents invalid operations
- Rate limiting protects against abuse
- Stored data is properly sanitized
- Security headers protect against common attacks

## Estimated Effort
12 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Related Files
- All API route files
- Validation middleware
- Security middleware

## Implementation Notes
- Implement validation at multiple layers (API, business logic, storage)
- Use tools like slowapi for rate limiting
- Sanitize user input before storage
- Add security headers middleware
