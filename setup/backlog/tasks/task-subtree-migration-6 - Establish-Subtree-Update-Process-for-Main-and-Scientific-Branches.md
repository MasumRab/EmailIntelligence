# Task: Establish Subtree Update Process for Main and Scientific Branches

## Description
Establish the process and documentation for updating setup files in the main and scientific branches using the new subtree structure.

## Steps
1. Document the process for updating setup files from the subtree
2. Create scripts or aliases to simplify subtree operations
3. Test the update process on both main and scientific branches
4. Document the process for team members

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create documentation for subtree pull operations
- [ ] Create helper scripts for common subtree operations
- [ ] Test updating setup files in main branch from subtree
- [ ] Test updating setup files in scientific branch from subtree
- [ ] Document the full process for team members
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for subtree operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clear documentation for subtree operations exists
- [ ] Team members can easily update setup files from subtree
- [ ] Process works reliably for both main and scientific branches
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide available for common issues
