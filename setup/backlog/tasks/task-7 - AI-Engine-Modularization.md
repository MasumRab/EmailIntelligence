# Task: AI Engine Modularization

## Priority
LOW

## Description
Add support for multiple AI backends and enhance AI engine capabilities.

## Current Implementation
Abstract BaseAIEngine with ModernAIEngine implementation.

## Requirements
1. Add support for multiple AI backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Implement model versioning and A/B testing capabilities
3. Add caching for AI analysis results
4. Create standardized interfaces for training new models

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple AI backends can be used interchangeably
- Model versioning and A/B testing are supported
- AI analysis results are cached appropriately
- Training interfaces are standardized and documented

## Estimated Effort
24 hours

## Dependencies
None
