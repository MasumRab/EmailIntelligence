# Task: Integrate Setup Subtree in Main Branch

## Description
Integrate the new setup subtree methodology into the main branch, allowing the main branch to pull updates from the shared setup directory while continuing independent development on application features.

## Steps
1. Update launch scripts in main branch to work with the new setup subtree structure
2. Create or update a git subtree relationship to pull from the setup directory
3. Test the launch functionality after integration
4. Update documentation to reflect the new process
5. Ensure all CI/CD processes account for the new structure

## Subtasks
- [ ] Update main branch launch scripts to reference setup subtree
- [ ] Test launch functionality from main branch after subtree integration
- [ ] Update main branch documentation to reflect subtree usage
- [ ] Update CI/CD configuration in main branch to account for subtree
- [ ] Verify backward compatibility with existing deployment processes
- [ ] Document process for applying setup updates to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main branch can successfully launch the application using setup subtree
- [ ] Main branch can receive updates from setup subtree
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline works correctly with new structure
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new workflow
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Task Dependencies
- Setup subtree directory structure created (completed)

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
8 hours

## Status
Pending

## Additional Notes
This integration will allow the main branch to continue its development while benefiting from centralized setup improvements. The team should be trained on how to pull updates from the setup subtree to ensure their launch functionality stays current.
