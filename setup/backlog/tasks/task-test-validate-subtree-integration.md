# Task: Test and Validate Subtree Integration on Both Branches

## Description
Comprehensive testing and validation of the subtree integration on both main and scientific branches to ensure functionality, compatibility, and reliability.

## Steps
1. Perform integration testing on main branch with subtree
2. Perform integration testing on scientific branch with subtree
3. Test the update propagation mechanism
4. Validate that both branches can continue to diverge independently
5. Document any issues and resolution procedures

## Subtasks
- [ ] Test complete application launch on main branch with subtree
- [ ] Test complete application launch on scientific branch with subtree
- [ ] Test propagation of a setup change to both branches
- [ ] Verify branches can continue independent development after subtree integration
- [ ] Test CI/CD pipelines on both branches with subtree integration
- [ ] Document any issues encountered and their solutions
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for subtree-related issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application launches successfully on both branches using subtree
- [ ] Setup changes can be propagated to both branches
- [ ] Both branches maintain independent development capabilities
- [ ] CI/CD processes work correctly with subtree integration
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide is available for common issues

## Task Dependencies
- task-implement-subtree-pull-main.md
- task-implement-subtree-pull-scientific.md

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
10 hours

## Status
Pending

## Additional Notes
This is a critical validation task to ensure the subtree integration works reliably in real-world usage. Both branches should continue to function independently while benefiting from shared setup improvements.
