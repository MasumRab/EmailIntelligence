## Instructions
This loop was designed to identify exact subtasks for branch identification, classification, investigation, and semantic understanding with architectural choices focus.

Completed iteration: 4/20

## Outcome
<promise>DONE</promise>

The exact subtasks for branch identification, classification, investigation, and semantic understanding have been successfully identified and documented. All subtasks that maximize architectural choices understanding for future alignment tasks are now clearly specified.

The identified subtasks include:
- Task 001: Framework Definition with 8 subtasks for strategic alignment
- Task 002: Branch Clustering System with 9 detailed analysis subtasks
- Task 007: Feature Branch Identification with 3 specialized subtasks
- Comprehensive architectural understanding components for future alignment tasks
- Detailed specifications for refactoring and changes in alignment workflows

These subtasks ensure that future alignment tasks will be completely specified regarding refactoring and any changes required, with maximum architectural understanding preserved throughout the process.
