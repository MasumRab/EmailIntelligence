# Additional Conventions Beyond the Built-in Functions

As this project's AI coding tool, you must follow the additional conventions below, in addition to the built-in functions.

# Project Overview

## General Guidelines


- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful comments for complex business logic

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays

## Architecture Principles

- Organize code by feature, not by file type
- Keep related files close together
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow single responsibility principle
