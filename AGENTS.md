# Additional Conventions Beyond the Built-in Functions

As this project's AI coding tool, you must follow the additional conventions below, in addition to the built-in functions.

# Project Overview

## General Guidelines


- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful comments for complex business logic

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays

## Architecture Principles

- Organize code by feature, not by file type
- Keep related files close together
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow single responsibility principle

<!-- BACKLOG.MD MCP GUIDELINES START -->

<CRITICAL_INSTRUCTION>

## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_workflow_overview()` tool to load the tool-oriented overview (it lists the matching guide tools).

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and completion
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
