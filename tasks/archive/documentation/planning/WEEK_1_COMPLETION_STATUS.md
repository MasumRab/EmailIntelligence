## Next Phase: Week 2-3 Integration

### Week 2: Task 001 (Framework)
- Copy enhanced task-7.md to task_files/task-001-FRAMEWORK-STRATEGY.md
- Implement Task 001.1-001.7 using provided schedule
- Establish weekly sync meetings with Task 002 team

### Week 3: Task 002 (Clustering)
- Extract 9 HANDOFF files to task_files/task-021-1 through task-021-9
- Begin Task 002 implementation using chosen strategy (parallel recommended)
- First data exchange with Task 001 team (clustering metrics)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Bidirectional Integration Works** - Task 001 and 002 running parallel with weekly sync will produce better quality than sequential execution
2. **Stage-Based Parallelization** - Task 002 Stage One (3 independent tasks) scales well with team size
3. **Configuration-Driven Design** - Both tasks use configurable parameters (weights, thresholds) that refine through feedback
4. **Clear Numbering Enables Clarity** - Moving from scattered Task 75 references to unified Task 002 makes scope immediately clear
