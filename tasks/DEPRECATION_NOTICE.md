# ⚠️ Deprecation Notice: `/tasks/` Folder

**Status:** Deprecated as of January 6, 2026  
**Replacement:** All active tasks consolidated to `new_task_plan/task_files/`  
**Read Permission:** Historical reference only

---

## What Happened

All task files have been consolidated to a single source of truth:

**→ `new_task_plan/task_files/`**

This folder is kept as a historical backup only.

---

## For Developers

**DO NOT use this folder for active work.**

Instead, reference:
- **`new_task_plan/task_files/task_007.md`** instead of `tasks/task_007.md`
- **`new_task_plan/task_files/task_075.*.md`** instead of `tasks/task_075.*.md`
- **`new_task_plan/task_files/task_0*.md`** instead of `tasks/task_0*.md`

All task specifications are identical in both locations, but `new_task_plan/task_files/` is the single source of truth going forward.

---

## For Reference

See `NEW_TASK_PLAN_CONSOLIDATION_STRATEGY.md` for the consolidation strategy and rationale.

---

## What's in This Folder (Historical)

This folder contains all the Phase 3 task specifications in their original format:
- 114 task files (all phases and statuses)
- Complete documentation history
- All task structures and specifications

**These files are no longer actively maintained.** Updates should be made in `new_task_plan/task_files/` only.
