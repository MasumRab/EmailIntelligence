# Task ID: 101

**Title:** Align All Orchestration-Tools Named Branches with Local Alignment Implementation

**Status:** pending

**Dependencies:** None

**Priority:** high

**Description:** Systematically align all branches with "orchestration-tools" in their name (see task_data/orchestration_branches.json for complete list of 24 precalculated branches) using a local implementation of the core alignment framework, ensuring each orchestration branch alignment is independent and properly validated.

**Details:**

Referenced orchestration-tools branches to align: See task_data/orchestration_branches.json for complete list of 24 branches to align

This task implements local copies of the core alignment framework (tasks 74-83) specifically for orchestration-tools branches. Rather than relying on external task dependencies, this task executes its own independent alignment process for orchestration branches with self-contained validation, error detection, integration utilities, documentation generation, and testing.

Each orchestration-tools branch will undergo: 1) Local Git repository protection validation, 2) Local branch identification and categorization, 3) Local error detection and correction, 4) Local integration utility application, 5) Local documentation generation, 6) Local modular framework application, 7) Local validation integration, 8) Local specialized handling for complex branches, 9) Local best practices documentation, 10) Local end-to-end testing and reporting.

The task maintains independence from the main alignment framework while implementing equivalent functionality specific to orchestration branches.

**Test Strategy:**

Execute the local alignment framework on each orchestration-tools branch and verify: 1) Proper validation of Git repository protections on each branch, 2) Effective error detection and correction within each branch, 3) Successful integration of changes, 4) Accurate documentation generation, 5) Proper validation framework integration, 6) Specialized handling of complex branches, 7) End-to-end functionality testing.
