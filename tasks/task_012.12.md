### 012.12. Implement Pause, Resume, and Cancellation Mechanisms

**Status:** pending  
**Dependencies:** 012.6, 012.13  

Develop functionality to allow the developer to pause the alignment workflow, resume from a paused state, or cancel the entire process gracefully at any point.

**Details:**

Integrate user input handlers (e.g., keyboard interrupts, specific CLI commands) to trigger pause/resume/cancel. Implement logic to halt the current operation, save the workflow state (for pause), and perform necessary cleanup (for cancel). Ensure graceful exit during cancellation.
