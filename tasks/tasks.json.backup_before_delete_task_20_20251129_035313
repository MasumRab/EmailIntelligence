THIS IS A FRAMEWORK-DEFINITION TASK, NOT A BRANCH-ALIGNMENT TASK. Task 7 defines HOW other feature branches should be aligned rather than performing the alignment of a specific branch. The output will be strategic documentation, decision criteria, and framework for other alignment tasks (77, 79, 81) to follow. CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: Do NOT create a branch for this task; it defines alignment strategy for other branches.

        "details": "CRITICAL PURPOSE CLARIFICATION:\n\nTHIS TASK DEFINES THE STRATEGY, NOT PERFORMS ALIGNMENT:\n\n1. CRITERIA FOR TARGET SELECTION: Establish rules for determining optimal target branch (main, scientific, orchestration-tools) based on: - Codebase similarity metrics - Shared Git history depth - Architectural alignment requirements - Project development priorities\n\n2. ALIGNMENT STRATEGY FRAMEWORK: Define strategic approach for: - When to use merge vs. rebase strategies during alignment - How to handle feature branches with large shared history - Guidelines for preserving architectural integrity during alignment - Best practices for branch targeting decisions\n\n3. DOCUMENTATION FOUNDATION: Establish: - How targeting decisions should be justified and documented - What criteria determine optimal integration targets - Framework for documenting alignment decisions - Methodology for future branch targeting decisions\n\n4. FRAMEWORK OUTPUTS: This task produces strategic documentation and decision criteria such as: - Target branch determination guidelines - Branch alignment best practices documentation - Framework for justifying alignment decisions - Criteria for handling complex alignment scenarios\n\nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:\n- This task does NOT create its own branch for alignment work\n- Instead, it creates the strategic framework that other tasks (77, 79, 81) will implement\n- Focus on documentation, criteria, and strategic planning\n- Do NOT perform actual Git operations on other feature branches\n\nRELATIONSHIP TO OTHER TASKS:\n- Task 1: Prerequisite - recovery work must be completed first\n- Tasks 74-78: Provide context and infrastructure for alignment strategy\n- Tasks 77, 79, 81: Will implement the strategy defined by Task 7\n\nCRITICAL CORRECTION: This task is a FRAMEWORK task that defines the process for aligning feature branches with their justified targets. It should NOT result in alignment of a specific branch but should establish: 1) Criteria for determining optimal target branch (main, scientific, orchestration-tools) based on codebase similarity and shared history, 2) Guidelines for when to use merge vs rebase strategies, 3) Process for identifying branches with large shared history requiring focused handling, 4) Framework for documenting alignment rationales, 5) Safety checks for branch alignment operations, 6) Verification procedures for successful alignment.\n\nThis high-priority task involves a coordinated effort to bring all active feature branches up-to-date with their determined optimal integration target branch.\n\n0.  **Determine Optimal Integration Target**: For each active feature branch, analyze its Git history and codebase similarity to `main`, `scientific`, and `orchestration-tools` to identify the most suitable integration target. This must be explicitly justified for each branch. If branches have similar names but different codebases, they should be renamed to match their content and/or target first. This alignment task aims to resolve architectural mismatches, not perform direct merges with large drift.\nCrucially, *this process avoids defaulting to 'scientific' as the target branch; the optimal integration target will depend entirely on the specifics of each branch*. Any changes, including conflict resolution and architectural adaptation, will be performed directly on the respective feature branch. The branch is considered 'finished' for alignment purposes once these changes are merged back into it, without the creation of extra, intermediate branches.\n\nPart 1: Feature Branch Assessment\n- Use `git branch --remote` and `git log` to identify all active branches diverging from 'scientific'.\n- Create a shared checklist (e.g., a repository markdown file) of branches to be aligned, including: `feature/backlog-ac-updates`, `docs-cleanup`, `feature/search-in-category`, `feature/merge-clean`, `feature/merge-setup-improvements`. Exclude `fix/import-error-corrections` as it's handled by Task 11. \n- Prioritize the branches based on importance and complexity of divergence.\n\nPart 2: Alignment Execution\n- For each branch, create a local backup first (e.g., `git branch <branch-name>-backup-pre-align`).\n- Check out the feature branch (`git checkout <feature-branch>`).\n- For public or shared branches, integrate changes *from* the determined target branch *into* the feature branch (e.g., `git merge <determined_target_branch>` or `git rebase <determined_target_branch>`). All changes, including conflict resolution, must be performed directly on the feature branch. No intermediate alignment branches will be created.\n- Systematically resolve any merge conflicts, using visual merge tools for clarity. Document complex resolutions in the merge commit message. Ensure the changes do not result in regression. If the source branch has a more advanced local architecture for the feature being integrated, that should be preferred, and the architecture of the target branch may need partial updating, which should be noted in documentation in the branch during the final PR.\n\nPart 3: Validation and Documentation\n- After each successful alignment, push the updated feature branch to the remote repository.\n- Create a Pull Request for each aligned feature branch to its determined optimal integration branch to allow for code review and automated CI checks.\n- Update the central alignment checklist to reflect the status of each branch.\n\n\n## Target Branch Context\n- Target: (determined per feature branch)\n- Source of latest changes for alignment: (e.g., `main`, `scientific`, `orchestration-tools` as determined)\n\n\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Identify all active feature branches that need alignment\n2. Create alignment plan for each feature branch\n3. Perform merges/rebases as appropriate\n4. Resolve conflicts systematically\n5. Validate functionality after alignment\n## Implementation Steps\n### Part 1: Feature Branch Assessment\n1. List all active feature branches\n2. Identify branches that have diverged significantly from scientific\n3. Assess complexity of alignment for each branch\n4. Prioritize branches based on importance and complexity\n### Part 2: Alignment Execution\n1. For each feature branch, create backup before alignment\n2. Perform merge/rebase with scientific branch\n3. Resolve conflicts following project standards\n4. Test functionality after alignment\n5. Update branch with aligned changes\n### Part 3: Validation and Documentation\n1. Verify all aligned branches build and run correctly\n2. Run relevant test suites for each branch\n3. Document alignment process for future reference\n4. Update backlog tasks to reflect new state\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:code-alignment`\n- `component:git-workflow`\n- `scope:devops`, `branch-management`\n- `purpose:consistency`, `merge-stability`",

        "details": "This task focuses on deeply integrating testing and validation processes into our task management and CI/CD pipelines, building upon the foundational 'Comprehensive Merge Validation Framework' established by Task 9. The goal is to enforce quality and consistency from task creation through to completion.\n\n1.  **Automated Testing Validation into Task Completion Workflow:** Enhance existing GitHub Actions workflows (as defined in Task 9 for `scientific` to `main` merges) to automatically validate test results upon pull request merges or task completion markers. This includes integrating coverage checks, static analysis results, and functional test suite outcomes directly into the task status reporting (e.g., via GitHub status checks or a custom webhook to a task tracking system).\n2.  **Adding Branch-Specific Task Tracking and Validation:** Implement mechanisms to differentiate validation rules and required checks based on the target branch (e.g., `main`, `scientific`, feature branches). This could involve conditional GitHub Actions workflows or specific branch protection rules that vary per branch type, ensuring that `scientific` branch merges, for instance, trigger specific 'scientific branch testing frameworks'.\n3.  **Incorporate Scientific Branch Testing Frameworks:** Develop and integrate specialized testing frameworks for the `scientific` branch within the CI/CD pipeline. This may involve setting up dedicated test environments, using specialized data sets for model validation, or incorporating statistical testing and reproducibility checks tailored for scientific computing or AI model evaluation within `src/backend`'s AI components. Leverage existing Python testing frameworks like `pytest` and extend them with custom plugins or reporting.\n4.  **Add Testing Requirement Enforcement in Task Creation:** Implement checks at the pull request creation or task definition stage to ensure testing requirements are met. This could include:\n    *   Pre-commit hooks or GitHub Actions checks requiring new or modified test files (`tests/`) to be present for new features/bug fixes.\n    *   Mandating minimum test coverage thresholds (e.g., via `pytest-cov` and reporting to Codecov/Coveralls) for affected modules in `src/backend` before a PR can be merged.\n    *   Enforcing specific labels or comments in PR descriptions that confirm testing strategy has been addressed.\n\nAll integrations should leverage existing GitHub and Python ecosystem tools where possible to minimize overhead, and refer to `src/backend` for all code-related implementations.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:feature-enhancement`, `ci-cd`\n- `component:testing-infrastructure`, `task-management`\n- `scope:devops`, `quality-assurance`\n- `purpose:quality-enforcement`, `automation`",

This includes testing with expected data variations.\n    *   **Requirement Enforcement:** Attempt to create PRs that intentionally violate testing requirements (e.g., no new tests for new features, low coverage) and confirm that the enforcement mechanisms (CI checks, pre-commit) correctly block the PR or flag the issue.\n3.  **Regression Testing:** Ensure that these new integrations do not adversely affect existing CI/CD pipelines or merge validation processes defined in Task 7.\n4.  **Documentation & User Acceptance:** Verify that the new requirements and workflows are clearly documented and understandable for developers, and conduct internal UAT to confirm usability and effectiveness.",

This may involve a combination of: \n    *   **Careful Merging:** Using a standard merge commit from 'main' into 'scientific', then resolving conflicts with high attention to detail.\n    *   **Cherry-picking:** Selectively applying specific commits from 'main' related to the missing features.\n    *   **Manual Integration:** For highly divergent sections, manually porting code while adapting it to the 'scientific' branch's context.\n    This strategy will avoid a direct merge of 'main' into 'scientific' without careful review and conflict resolution, instead focusing on integrating features incrementally and resolving conflicts directly within the `scientific` branch or a temporary working branch for the recovery. This alignment task aims to resolve architectural mismatches, not perform direct merges with large drift.\n3.  **Preservation of Scientific-Specific Code:** Explicitly identify and isolate the 'scientific'-specific context management scripts and any other unique features. Ensure these are either untouched, carefully merged, refactored, or adapted to coexist with the 'main' features without loss or regression. Document any structural changes made to these components. If the 'scientific'-specific code represents a more advanced or specialized architectural pattern for its domain, this will be prioritized, and features from 'main' will be integrated in a manner that respects and complements it, potentially requiring minor architectural adaptations within 'scientific' that will be documented in the final PR.\n4.  **Conflict Resolution:** Resolve all merge conflicts, prioritizing the stable functionality from 'main' for the identified missing features, and preserving 'scientific'-specific logic where applicable.\n5.  **Pre-merge and Post-merge Code Review:** Conduct thorough peer reviews on the planned merge approach and then on the resulting merged code before finalization.\n6.  **Documentation of Recovery:** Document the entire recovery process, including the merge strategy, specific files/directories integrated, conflicts encountered and resolutions, and any manual code adaptations, for future reference and disaster recovery planning.\n7.  **Direct Branch Modification**: All integration work, including merging, cherry-picking, conflict resolution, and manual code adaptations, will be performed directly on the `scientific` branch (or a dedicated, short-lived recovery branch derived from `scientific` which is then immediately merged back into `scientific`). No intermediate, long-lived alignment branches will be created, ensuring changes are applied and verified within the `scientific` branch itself.\n8.  **Future Branch Sync Strategy (Initial):** Based on the recovery, draft an initial proposal or requirements for a continuous branch synchronization strategy to prevent such divergence in the future. This will likely inform a subsequent dedicated task. This strategy should also aim to prevent the need for broad architectural updates of the `scientific` branch during future syncs.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:branch-recovery`\n- `work_type:feature-integration`\n- `component:git-workflow`\n- `component:backend-core`\n- `scope:scientific-branch`\n- `scope:architectural`\n- `purpose:data-integrity`\n- `purpose:functional-restoration`",

This includes: \n    *   **Unit Tests:** Verify individual component functionality.\n    *   **Integration Tests:** Validate interactions between integrated modules and existing 'scientific' components.\n    *   **Automated Import Validation (Task 18):** Confirm all modules, especially the newly merged ones and critical 'scientific' components, can be imported without errors.\n    *   **Pre-merge Validation Scripts (Task 19):** If applicable to post-merge, run these to ensure critical files remain intact.\n4.  **Manual Functional Testing:** \n    *   **Main Features Verification:** Systematically test all functionalities brought over from 'main' (e.g., command pattern operations, backend data persistence, core application flows).\n    *   **Scientific Features Verification:** Manually verify the continued functionality and integrity of all 'scientific'-specific features, particularly the context management scripts and any associated workflows.\n5.  **Regression Testing:** Execute comprehensive regression tests to ensure that existing functionalities within the 'scientific' branch have not been adversely affected by the merge.\n6.  **Data Integrity Check:** If backend structure changes were significant, perform data integrity checks on a representative dataset to ensure consistency and prevent data loss.\n7.  **Rollback Plan Validation:** Confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of a rollback strategy should critical, unresolvable issues arise post-merge.",

        "description": "Establish a robust system of pre-merge and post-merge validations, selective revert policies, branch-specific asset preservation, and documentation to prevent future regressions and accidental data loss during merge operations.",
        "details": "This task focuses on implementing the strategic safeguards identified in the forensic analysis to prevent patterns that caused recent damage. The implementation will encompass a multi-faceted approach utilizing Git features, CI/CD pipeline enhancements, and detailed policy documentation.\n\n1.  **Pre-merge Validation for Deletions with Replacements:**\n    *   **Action**: Enhance existing pre-merge validation scripts (from Task 17, e.g., `scripts/validate_critical_files.py`) and CI/CD checks (from Task 7, e.g., in `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml`) to detect critical file or module deletions. If a deletion is identified, the merge request must either include a functional replacement for the deleted component or explicit, documented approval from a designated lead, detailing the necessity and safety of the deletion.\n    *   **Implementation**: This may involve comparing file lists between branches using Git diff capabilities (`git diff --name-only <target-branch>...<source-branch>`) or integrating static analysis tools that flag significant removals. The CI/CD pipeline should be configured to run this check as a mandatory status check.\n\n2.  **Selective Revert Policy Implementation:**\n    *   **Action**: Establish and enforce a policy that discourages or blocks mass reverts, favoring selective reverts for specific problematic commits or changes. This ensures that unrelated, functional code is not accidentally removed.\n    *   **Implementation**: Utilize Git hooks or enhance branch protection rules (from Task 18) to flag merge requests containing large revert operations. Provide developers with tools and training on `git revert -n` followed by cherry-picking, or `git cherry-pick` of specific desired changes, instead of blanket `git revert` of large merges. The policy document (point 5, e.g., `docs/dev_guides/merge_best_practices.md`) will detail this.\n\n3.  **Branch-Specific Feature Preservation during Syncs:**\n    *   **Action**: Implement mechanisms to protect critical branch-specific assets (e.g., specific AI agent configurations like `config/agent_settings.json`, scientific models in `src/models/`, or unique data schemas) from being overwritten or deleted during merges or synchronizations from other branches (e.g., `main` into `scientific`).\n    *   **Implementation**: Identify all critical `scientific` branch-specific files and directories. Utilize Git's `.gitattributes` for specific merge strategies (e.g., `merge=ours` for certain paths) or develop custom merge drivers/scripts to handle conflicts in these specific areas. Integrate CI/CD checks that warn or block merges attempting to force-overwrite these protected assets without explicit conflict resolution.\n\n4.  **Automated Post-Merge Validation of Critical Functionality:**\n    *   **Action**: Extend the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., in `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to include a robust suite of post-merge integration and end-to-end tests that specifically target the critical functionalities of the `scientific` branch. This ensures that even if pre-merge checks pass, no subtle regressions were introduced that manifest only after integration.\n    *   **Implementation**: Expand on the CI/CD framework provided by Task 7. This includes writing new integration tests for core scientific workflows, AI agent interactions, and critical data processing pipelines. These tests must run on the target branch (e.g., `scientific`) immediately after a successful merge, and their failure should trigger high-priority alerts and rollback procedures.\n\n5.  **Documentation of Merge Best Practices and Recovery Procedures:**\n    *   **Action**: Collaborate with Task 19 to create and publish comprehensive documentation covering the newly implemented policies, best practices for merging, how to perform selective reverts, procedures for preserving branch-specific assets, and step-by-step recovery guides for various types of merge-related regressions or errors.\n    *   **Implementation**: Develop detailed guides (e.g., `docs/dev_guides/merge_best_practices.md`, `docs/dev_guides/regression_recovery.md`) that are easily accessible to all development team members. Include examples and common pitfalls. Conduct training sessions for developers on these new procedures and tools.\n\n### Scope Creep Note:\nThis task encompasses a very broad range of security and stability safeguards (pre-merge validations, revert policies, asset preservation, post-merge validations, documentation). While all are related to preventing regressions, each could represent a substantial work item that might be better managed as a separate, smaller task or initiative to improve granularity and tracking. For example, \"Pre-merge Validation for Deletions with Replacements\" or \"Branch-Specific Feature Preservation during Syncs\" could be standalone tasks.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:safeguard-implementation`\n- `work_type:ci-cd`\n- `component:merge-management`\n- `component:git-policy`\n- `scope:devops`\n- `scope:quality-assurance`\n- `purpose:regression-prevention`\n- `purpose:data-integrity`\n- `purpose:stability`",
        "testStrategy": "1.  **Pre-merge Deletion Validation:**\n    *   Create a feature branch that intentionally deletes a critical file/module without a replacement. Open a PR targeting a protected branch and verify that the CI/CD pipeline or pre-merge hook correctly blocks the merge.\n    *   Create another feature branch that deletes a critical file/module but includes a valid, functional replacement. Open a PR and verify the check passes, allowing the merge.\n\n2.  **Selective Revert Policy:**\n    *   Attempt to perform a mass revert of a significant feature (e.g., 50+ commits) on a test branch. Verify that the system flags this action or requires special approval according to the new policy.\n    *   Demonstrate a successful selective revert using `git cherry-pick` or `git revert -n` for a specific problematic change, ensuring other unrelated changes are preserved.\n\n3.  **Branch-Specific Preservation:**\n    *   In a feature branch, modify a `scientific`-specific critical file (e.g., `scientific/models/agent_config.json`). Simulate a merge from `main` where `main` also has changes to this file or attempts to delete it. Verify that a merge conflict is correctly raised, preventing accidental overwrites, and the `scientific`-specific changes are preserved through correct conflict resolution.\n    *   If using `.gitattributes`, verify that a direct merge attempt that would normally overwrite a protected file instead preserves the target branch's version or forces manual intervention.\n\n4.  **Post-Merge Validation:**\n    *   Introduce a subtle regression in a feature branch that passes pre-merge checks but would cause a failure in a critical `scientific` functionality (e.g., a specific AI agent workflow) upon integration. Merge this feature branch into a test `scientific` branch.\n    *   Verify that the automated post-merge validation suite correctly identifies the regression and causes the pipeline to fail, triggering alerts.\n    *   Resolve the regression in a follow-up PR and verify that the post-merge validation passes successfully.\n\n5.  **Documentation Review:**\n    *   Conduct a peer review of the new documentation (`merge_best_practices.md`, `regression_recovery.md`) with developers who were not directly involved in its creation. Gather feedback on clarity, completeness, and usability.\n    *   Perform a mock recovery exercise using the documented procedures for a simulated merge error (e.g., accidentally deleted component) to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the recovery steps.",

The goal is to eliminate any `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` markers that indicate unresolved conflicts, which can cause subtle bugs or compilation issues.\n\n1.  **Preparation**: Ensure local repository is up-to-date by running `git fetch --all --prune`. This fetches all remote branches and removes any stale local tracking branches.\n2.  **Branch Iteration**: Programmatically (e.g., using a shell script or Python script) or manually, iterate through every remote-tracking branch (e.g., `origin/main`, `origin/develop`, `origin/feature-X`). For each remote branch:\n    a.  Checkout a new local branch based on the remote branch: `git checkout -b fix/resolve-conflicts-<branch_name> <remote>/<branch_name>`.\n    b.  **Conflict Identification**: Use `git grep -l '<<<<<<<\\|=======\\|>>>>>>>'` across all tracked files to pinpoint files containing merge conflict markers. Focus on all text-based files, including but not limited to: Python files (`src/**/*.py`, `setup/**/*.py`, `scripts/**/*.py`, `tests/**/*.py`), JSON files (e.g., `data/processed/email_data.json`), Markdown documentation (`*.md` files like `AGENTS.md`, `docs/**/*.md`), configuration files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`).\n    c.  **Resolution**: For each identified file, manually inspect and carefully resolve the merge conflict. This requires understanding the context of the conflict and making the correct decision to preserve desired code/data.\n        *   **Python files**: Ensure correct syntax and logical flow after resolution.\n        *   **JSON files**: Validate the JSON structure after resolution. If `data/processed/email_data.json` is affected, pay special attention to data integrity; consider leveraging insights or tooling related to `scripts/restore_json_data.sh` if data corruption is a risk.\n        *   **Documentation files**: Ensure the intended content is preserved and formatting remains consistent.\n    d.  **Commit**: Once conflicts in a branch are resolved, commit the changes with a clear message: `git commit -am 'FIX: Resolved merge conflicts on <branch_name>'`.\n    e.  **Push and PR**: Push the `fix/resolve-conflicts-<branch_name>` branch to remote and, if applicable, open a Pull Request against the original remote branch, requesting review and merge.\n3.  **Documentation**: Maintain a log of all branches where conflicts were found, the files affected, and a brief description of the resolution applied.

        "details": "This task involves designing and implementing a robust test suite for the critical `context_control` module to ensure its correctness, reliability, and maintainability. The tests should adhere to modern Python testing best practices using `pytest`.\n\n**Components to Cover:**\n*   `BranchMatcher`: Test various branch name patterns, wildcards, and edge cases.\n*   `EnvironmentTypeDetector`: Test detection logic for different environment variables or configuration settings.\n*   `ContextFileResolver`: Test resolution logic for context files (e.g., `context.json`, `.context.yaml`) across different directories and fallbacks. Include tests for missing files and incorrect paths.\n*   `ContextValidator`: Develop specific test cases for all five (or current number of) validation rules implemented within this component. This includes schema validation, value constraints, existence checks, and data type verification.\n*   `ContextCreator`: Test the creation of context objects, including default values, merging strategies, and handling of incomplete data.\n*   `ContextController`: This orchestrator component requires integration tests to ensure correct interaction between `Resolver`, `Validator`, `Creator`, and `ProfileManager`. Mock external dependencies as appropriate.\n*   `ProfileStorage`: Test persistence (e.g., read/write operations to file system or database), retrieval, and error handling for profile data. Consider different storage formats if applicable.\n*   `ProfileManager`: Test the management of user or project profiles, including CRUD operations, active profile selection, and data consistency.\n\n**Key Testing Considerations:**\n1.  **Unit Tests:** For each component, write isolated unit tests. Utilize `pytest` fixtures for setup and `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for dependency mocking.\n2.  **Dependency Injection (DI) Patterns:** Ensure tests properly mock injected dependencies to verify individual component logic. If DI containers are used, test their configuration.\n3.  **Edge Cases & Error Handling:** Explicitly test invalid inputs, missing configurations, malformed context files, and expected error propagation.\n4.  **Legacy Compatibility Layer:** Identify specific code paths or data structures designed for backward compatibility and create targeted tests to ensure they function as expected without regressions.\n5.  **Test Data:** Generate realistic but synthetic test data using `faker` or custom fixtures to cover a wide range of scenarios.\n6.  **Code Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (e.g., 90%+) for all `context_control` components using `pytest-cov`.\n7.  **Test File Structure:** Organize tests logically, typically mirroring the source code structure (e.g., `tests/unit/context_control/`).\n<info added on 2025-11-13T18:06:04.287Z>\n\"### Further Testing Considerations from Refactoring Analysis\\n*   **Legacy Compatibility Layer**: Expand testing for compatibility layers (e.g., deprecation shims, adapters like `ContextValidatorLegacy` in `src/context_control/validation.py`, and module-level functions in `src/context_control/core.py`). This includes verifying correct delegation to new instance methods, ensuring proper emission of `DeprecationWarning`s using `pytest.warns()`, and critically, confirming that these layers maintain context isolation integrity by correctly passing context-specific arguments and ensuring proper dependency initialization.\\n*   **Context Isolation Integrity**: Develop explicit tests to verify that `AgentContext` instances, whether created directly or via compatibility shims, correctly enforce isolation boundaries (e.g., file access, environment type) and prevent cross-context contamination. This is crucial to ensure shims do not inadvertently break isolation.\\n*   **Thread Safety**: For components managing configuration or shared state, particularly `ContextController` after its configuration refactoring (Task 35), include tests to verify thread-safe behavior and ensure context isolation is preserved under concurrent access.\\n\\n### Refined Test Strategy Points\\n*   **Integration Testing for `ContextController`**: Enhance integration tests to cover legacy code paths that utilize deprecated module-level functions or static methods. Verify that the system behaves correctly through the compatibility layers and maintains context isolation during these legacy interactions.\\n*   **Dependency Injection Verification**: Ensure tests cover scenarios where `ContextController` is instantiated without explicit dependencies, relying on its internal defaults, as would happen when deprecation shims are used. Verify that these default dependencies are correctly initialized and utilized.\\n*   **Legacy Compatibility Scenarios**: In addition to functional verification, explicitly test for the proper emission of `DeprecationWarning`s using `pytest.warns()` when legacy interfaces are invoked. Confirm that context isolation is maintained and context-specific arguments are correctly passed through these legacy paths.\\n*   **Deprecation Warning Configuration**: Configure the `pytest` environment to always show `DeprecationWarning`s during test runs (e.g., using `warnings.simplefilter('always', DeprecationWarning)` within tests or `pytest` configuration). This will help identify all remaining usages of deprecated APIs and ensure warnings are correctly emitted, aiding in the migration process.\"\n</info added on 2025-11-13T18:06:04.287Z>",
        "testStrategy": "1.  **Setup Test Environment:** Ensure a `pytest` environment is configured with `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting and `pytest-mock` for mocking.\n2.  **Component-Specific Unit Testing:** Write granular unit tests for each public method and critical private method of `BranchMatcher`, `EnvironmentTypeDetector`, `ContextFileResolver`, `ContextValidator`, `ContextCreator`, `ProfileStorage`, and `ProfileManager`. Focus on input validation, output correctness, and error scenarios.\n3.  **ContextValidator Deep Dive:** For each of the identified validators within `ContextValidator`, create dedicated test cases to verify its specific rules, including valid data, invalid data (e.g., wrong type, out of range, missing required fields), and edge cases.\n4.  **Integration Testing for `ContextController`:** Develop integration tests that simulate the full flow of `ContextController`, ensuring it correctly orchestrates the resolution, validation, creation, and management of contexts. Use mock objects sparingly here, primarily for external system interactions (e.g., file system, network). Enhance integration tests to cover legacy code paths that utilize deprecated module-level functions or static methods. Verify that the system behaves correctly through the compatibility layers and maintains context isolation during these legacy interactions.\n5.  **Dependency Injection Verification:** For components relying on DI, write tests that demonstrate they correctly receive and utilize their dependencies, and that these dependencies can be effectively mocked for isolation. Ensure tests cover scenarios where `ContextController` is instantiated without explicit dependencies, relying on its internal defaults, as would happen when deprecation shims are used. Verify that these default dependencies are correctly initialized and utilized.\n6.  **Legacy Compatibility Scenarios:** Based on identified legacy touchpoints, create specific test scenarios that exercise the legacy compatibility layer, verifying that old formats or behaviors are still supported or correctly handled. In addition to functional verification, explicitly test for the proper emission of `DeprecationWarning`s using `pytest.warns()` when legacy interfaces are invoked.

All tests must pass.\n8.  **Coverage Analysis:** Generate a code coverage report and ensure critical `context_control` components meet the target coverage threshold. Prioritize adding tests for uncovered lines.\n9.  **CI/CD Integration:** Ensure the new test suite is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, running automatically on pull requests and merges to prevent regressions.",

        "description": "Implement backward compatibility shims for removed `context_control` static methods by providing deprecated static wrappers that instantiate and call their new instance-based alternatives, issuing a `DeprecationWarning` for each.",
        "details": "This task involves creating backward-compatible static methods within the `src/backend/context_control/context_control.py` module (or the relevant file where these classes are defined) that will wrap the corresponding new instance methods. This is crucial for smooth migration and to guide developers away from outdated static method usage.\n\n1.  **Identify Target Methods and Their Instance Equivalents:**\n    *   `BranchMatcher.find_profile_for_branch()` -> wraps `BranchMatcher(branch_name).find_profile_for_branch_instance()`\n    *   `EnvironmentTypeDetector.determine_environment_type()` -> wraps `EnvironmentTypeDetector(env_vars).determine_environment_type_instance()`\n    *   `ContextFileResolver.resolve_accessible_files()` -> wraps `ContextFileResolver(base_path).resolve_accessible_files_instance(patterns)`\n    *   `ContextValidator.validate_context()` -> wraps `ContextValidator(context_data).validate_context_instance()`\n\n2.  **Implement Deprecation Wrapper for Each Static Method:**\n    *   For each of the identified static methods, modify or re-add it as a `staticmethod` that performs the following actions:\n        a.  **Issue `DeprecationWarning`:** Use `warnings.warn()` to emit a `DeprecationWarning`. The message should clearly state that the static method is deprecated and advise on using the instance-based approach. Set `stacklevel=2` to ensure the warning points to the caller of the deprecated method.\n            *   Example message structure: `f\"Call to deprecated static method {ClassName}.{static_method_name}(). Instantiate `{ClassName}` and call `{instance_method_name}()` instead.\"`\n        b.  **Instantiate the Class:** Based on the signature of the deprecated static method, extract the necessary arguments to instantiate the corresponding class. For example, for `BranchMatcher.find_profile_for_branch(branch_name)`, `branch_name` should be used to create `BranchMatcher(branch_name=branch_name)`.\n        c.  **Call Instance Method:** Call the new instance method on the created object, passing any remaining arguments from the static method's original signature.\n        d.  **Return Result:** Return the result of the instance method call.\n\n3.  **Example Implementation Snippet (Illustrative for `BranchMatcher`):**\n    ```python\n    import warnings\n    from typing import Optional # Assuming this is needed\n\n    class BranchMatcher:\n        def __init__(self, branch_name: str):\n            self.branch_name = branch_name\n\n        def find_profile_for_branch_instance(self) -> Optional[str]:\n            # ... actual instance logic ...\n            return \"default_profile\" # Placeholder\n\n        @staticmethod\n        def find_profile_for_branch(branch_name: str) -> Optional[str]:\n            warnings.warn(\n                f\"Call to deprecated static method BranchMatcher.find_profile_for_branch(). \"\n                f\"Instantiate `BranchMatcher` and call `find_profile_for_branch_instance()` instead.\",\n                DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2\n            )\n            # Map static method arguments to constructor and instance method\n            matcher_instance = BranchMatcher(branch_name=branch_name)\n            return matcher_instance.find_profile_for_branch_instance()\n    ```\n\n4.  **Review Parameter Mapping:** Carefully analyze the argument signatures of the original static methods and their corresponding new instance methods and class constructors to ensure correct argument passing within the shims.\n\n5.  **Documentation:** Add comments to the deprecated static methods indicating their deprecation and guiding towards the new usage pattern.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:backward-compatibility`\n- `work_type:refactoring`\n- `component:context-control`\n- `component:api-design`\n- `scope:module-specific`\n- `purpose:smooth-migration`\n- `purpose:developer-experience`",

This could be a static method within `ContextController` (e.g., `ContextController.from_config_source()`) or a separate `ContextConfigFactory` class. This factory will be responsible for encapsulating the logic of reading config files, environment variables, or other sources.\n3.  **Explicit Config Passing:** Modify `ContextController`'s constructor (`__init__`) to accept its configuration explicitly as an argument, rather than relying on global state. This makes dependencies clear and the class more testable.\n4.  **Ensure Thread-Safe Config Singleton (if applicable):** If the loaded configuration itself needs to be a singleton across the application, ensure its instantiation and retrieval via the factory is thread-safe. This might involve using `threading.Lock` or `functools.lru_cache` with a lock if the config loading is expensive and should only happen once. The primary goal is thread-safe *config initialization*, so the singleton pattern should be applied to the config loading process, not necessarily the `ContextController` instance itself.\n5.  **Document Initialization Order:** Update the relevant documentation (e.g., `docs/dev_guides/context_control_module.md` if it exists, or a new section in `src/backend/context_control/README.md`) to clearly describe the new configuration initialization flow, the role of the factory, and how `ContextController` instances receive their configuration.\n6.  **Update Call Sites:** Identify and update all parts of the codebase that instantiate or rely on `ContextController` to use the new factory pattern and explicit config passing.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:refactoring`\n- `work_type:architectural-improvement`\n- `component:context-control`\n- `component:configuration`\n- `scope:thread-safety`\n- `scope:backend-core`\n- `purpose:stability`\n- `purpose:predictability`\n- `purpose:testability`",

This is crucial for leveraging newer language features, performance improvements, and maintaining compatibility with current ecosystem standards.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n\n1.  **`pyproject.toml` Update:**\n    *   Modify the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section to change `python = \">=3.11,<3.12\"` to `python = \">=3.12\"` or `python = \">=3.12,<3.13\"` depending on the desired upper bound. Verify any other `python = \"...\"` entries.\n\n2.  **`Dockerfile` Update:**\n    *   Locate the base image declaration in `Dockerfile` (e.g., `FROM python:3.11-slim-buster`) and update it to `FROM python:3.12-slim-buster` or an appropriate 3.12 base image.\n\n3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**\n    *   In the `jobs.build.steps` section, find the `actions/setup-python@vX` step and change `python-version: '3.11'` to `python-version: '3.12'`.\n    *   Review other workflow files in `.github/workflows/` for similar Python version specifications.\n\n4.  **Documentation Updates:**\n    *   Edit `README.md` to reflect 'Python 3.12 or higher' in the requirements section.\n    *   Update `docs/dev_setup.md` (or similar developer setup guides) to recommend Python 3.12 for development environments.\n    *   Check for any other `.md` files in the `docs/` directory that might mention specific Python versions.\n\n5.  **`setup.py` (if applicable):**\n    *   If a `setup.py` file exists, update `python_requires='>=3.11'` to `python_requires='>=3.12'`.\n    *   Review the `classifiers` list to ensure `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12` is present and remove or deprioritize `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11` if appropriate.\n\n6.  **Hardcoded Version Checks in Python Files:**\n    *   Search the codebase (e.g., `src/launch.py`, `src/main.py`, or any entry point scripts) for `sys.version_info` checks or similar hardcoded version requirements.

The focus is on ensuring `launch.py` remains stable and its dependencies are accurately managed through the merge process.\n\n1.  **Dependency Analysis and Refinement for `src/launch.py`:**\n    *   Utilize the findings from Task 38. Re-run or extend dependency analysis using tools like `deptry` or `pipdeptree` specifically for `src/launch.py` and its imported modules (e.g., modules from `src/`, `setup/`).\n    *   Identify all direct and indirect runtime dependencies of `launch.py`.\n    *   Cross-reference with `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. Flag any discrepancies.\n    *   Identify and remove any unnecessary, legacy, or unused imports within `src/launch.py` using tools like `pylint` or `isort` configured with an unused import check. Document the removal process.\n\n2.  **Required Files Identification for Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   Based on the dependency analysis, identify the set of critical files that, if altered or missing during a merge, would directly impact `launch.py`'s functionality. This includes `src/launch.py` itself, its directly imported modules (e.g., files under `src/` or `setup/commands/` if `launch.py` uses them), and any configuration files it implicitly or explicitly loads.\n    *   Integrate this list with the critical files identified in Task 19 for a comprehensive pre-merge validation scope. Document these files, perhaps in `docs/dev_guides/critical_files.md`.\n\n3.  **Update Orchestration Checks, Hooks, and Workflows:**\n    *   **CI/CD Workflow Update:** Modify the relevant GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml`) to include new or updated checks.\n        *   **Dependency Drift Check:** Add a step to run `deptry --check-only` or a custom script against `src/launch.py` to detect new, missing, or unused dependencies. This check should fail if unauthorized dependency changes are detected.\n        *   **Critical File Presence/Integrity Check:** Enhance the pre-merge validation scripts (potentially from Task 19) to specifically include the identified critical files related to `launch.py`. This ensures their existence and basic integrity (e.g., not empty, parseable if JSON/YAML) before merge.\n    *   **Pre-merge Hooks:** Explore integrating a subset of these checks as local Git pre-push or pre-commit hooks to provide earlier feedback to developers.\n    *   **Documentation Update:** Update `docs/dev_guides/merge_best_practices.md` (Task 21) to reflect these new checks and procedures for `launch.py` related merges.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:refinement`\n- `work_type:ci-cd`\n- `component:cli`\n- `component:git-workflow`\n- `scope:dependency-management`\n- `scope:merge-stability`\n- `purpose:reliability`\n- `purpose:maintainability`",

Create a PR and verify the CI/CD workflow fails.\n    *   Introduce an unused import in `src/launch.py`. Create a PR and verify the CI/CD workflow fails due to the unused import check.\n2.  **Critical File Integrity Test:**\n    *   On a feature branch, intentionally delete or corrupt one of the critical files identified as essential for `launch.py` (e.g., a core module it imports). Create a PR and verify the CI/CD workflow (or pre-merge hook) blocks the merge due to the missing/corrupt file.\n3.  **Merge Validation Test:**\n    *   Simulate a conflict scenario where `src/launch.py` or one of its critical dependencies is modified differently on two branches. Attempt to merge and verify that the defined orchestration checks provide clear feedback on how to resolve the conflict (e.g., highlighting missing dependencies or file issues).\n4.  **Local Hook Verification:** If pre-merge hooks are implemented, verify they correctly trigger when attempting to commit/push changes that violate the new rules for `launch.py` dependencies or critical files.",

        "details": "This task focuses on building out the complete production deployment ecosystem. It will leverage existing foundational elements while introducing new best practices for reliability, scalability, and observability.\n\n1.  **Refine Containerization (Docker):**\n    *   Enhance the existing `Dockerfile` to implement multi-stage builds. The current `Dockerfile` is a good starting point, but production images should be minimal (e.g., `FROM python:3.9-slim-buster` for builder stage, then copy artifacts to a `FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-slim` or `alpine` based runtime image) to reduce attack surface and image size.\n    *   Optimize Docker image layers and caching for faster CI/CD build times.\n    *   Configure Uvicorn for production with Gunicorn workers to handle concurrency effectively (e.g., `gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker src.backend.main:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8000`). This would require updating the `CMD` instruction in the `Dockerfile`.\n2.  **Develop Production CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):**\n    *   Extend `.github/workflows/main.yml` to include dedicated production deployment jobs. This pipeline will be triggered upon successful merge to `main` (or a release tag).\n    *   Integrate Docker image vulnerability scanning (e.g., using `snyk/scan@v1` or `aquasecurity/trivy-action@master`) as a mandatory step before pushing to a production container registry.\n    *   Implement environment-specific configuration management. Secrets and sensitive environment variables for production must be securely managed via GitHub Environments Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, or Azure Key Vault, rather than being hardcoded.\n    *   Define deployment targets and strategy. This will involve choosing a cloud provider (e.g., AWS ECS/EKS, GCP Cloud Run/GKE, Azure App Services/AKS) and implementing the deployment logic within the GitHub Actions workflow, potentially using existing cloud provider actions.\n    *   Incorporate automated rollback mechanisms for failed deployments to ensure high availability.\n    *   Ensure all existing checks from Task 7 (Merge Validation Framework) and Task 10 (Advanced Testing Integration), including unit, integration, and architectural tests, are successfully passed before any production deployment is initiated.\n3.  **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**\n    *   Integrate Application Performance Monitoring (APM) to collect metrics such as request latency, error rates, CPU/memory usage, and database query performance. Examples include Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, or cloud-native solutions (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Operations, Azure Monitor).\n    *   Set up centralized logging for all application instances in the production environment. This could involve an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or cloud-native logging services.\n    *   Configure robust alerting rules based on critical thresholds for metrics (e.g., 5xx error rate spikes, high latency, resource exhaustion) and specific log patterns. Alerts should integrate with communication channels like PagerDuty or Slack.\n    *   Add `/health` and `/readiness` endpoints to `src/backend/main.py` for container orchestration platforms to use for liveness and readiness probes.\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:infrastructure-setup`\n- `work_type:ci-cd`\n- `component:deployment`\n- `component:monitoring`\n- `scope:production`\n- `scope:devops`\n- `purpose:reliability`\n- `purpose:scalability`",

Check the image size and ensure multi-stage build optimization is effective.\n2.  **CI/CD Pipeline Validation (Staging):** Create a dedicated staging environment that mirrors the production configuration as closely as possible. Trigger a full CI/CD run, from a mock 'production release' event to successful deployment in staging. Verify that all pipeline steps (build, vulnerability scan, tests, deployment to staging) execute successfully without manual intervention.\n3.  **Security Scan Test:** Intentionally introduce a known vulnerable package into `requirements.txt` (if applicable) and verify that the Docker image vulnerability scan step in the CI/CD pipeline correctly identifies it and either fails the pipeline or flags a critical warning.\n4.  **Monitoring and Alerting Test:** After a successful deployment to staging, verify that APM dashboards are populated with real-time metrics. Simulate an application error or high load condition in staging and confirm that configured alerts trigger correctly in the designated communication channels (e.g., Slack).\n5.  **Rollback Mechanism Test:** In the staging environment, intentionally cause a deployment failure (e.g., by introducing a syntax error in a critical configuration file or failing a health check). Verify that the automated rollback mechanism successfully reverts to the previous stable version.\n6.  **Dependency Fulfillment:** Confirm that the production deployment pipeline successfully incorporates and validates the output from Task 7's merge validation framework and Task 10's advanced testing integrations, ensuring only high-quality code reaches production.",

        "details": "This task involves a multi-faceted approach to enhance the security posture of the application for production deployment, building upon the foundational work of production infrastructure setup (Task 12) and the merge validation framework (Task 7).\n\n1.  **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:**\n    *   Integrate an automated dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `pip-audit` or `safety`) into the CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. This should run on every `push` to `main` and `scientific` branches and during pull requests.\n    *   Configure the scanner to fail builds if critical or high-severity vulnerabilities are detected in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.\n    *   Establish a process for regular review and remediation of reported vulnerabilities.\n\n2.  **Secure Configuration Management:**\n    *   Review all application configurations within `src/backend/config.py` (or similar) to ensure no sensitive information is hardcoded. All sensitive settings must be loaded from environment variables.\n    *   Verify that `Dockerfile` does not bake in any secrets or sensitive configurations. Ensure `ENV` variables are used only for non-sensitive data or defaults.\n    *   Implement a configuration schema validation to prevent malformed or insecure configurations from being deployed.\n\n3.  **Secrets Management:**\n    *   For the CI/CD pipeline, ensure all necessary credentials are securely managed using GitHub Secrets, not exposed in plain text in workflow files (`.github/workflows/main.yml`).\n    *   For the actual production environment (as defined in Task 12), integrate with a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets) to store and retrieve application secrets at runtime. Access to these secrets must be strictly controlled and audited.\n    *   Implement a strategy for regular secret rotation.\n\n4.  **API Security Review and Implementation:**\n    *   Conduct a thorough review of all API endpoints defined in `src/backend/api` for proper authentication (e.g., using FastAPI's `Security` and `Depends` with `OAuth2PasswordBearer` or API keys).\n    *   Ensure robust input validation for all incoming requests, leveraging FastAPI's Pydantic models to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows.\n    *   Implement secure CORS policies in `src/backend/main.py` to restrict access to trusted origins only.\n    *   Review and enhance error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in production error responses.\n\n5.  **Rate Limiting:**\n    *   Implement API rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and abuse. Utilize a library such as `fastapi-limiter` or a custom middleware.\n    *   Configure global rate limits and, where necessary, specific endpoint-level limits within `src/backend/main.py` or a dedicated middleware file.\n    *   Integrate rate limiting failures into the monitoring system.\n\n6.  **Security Monitoring and Alerting:**\n    *   Integrate security-focused logging within the FastAPI application (e.g., logging failed authentication attempts, suspicious request patterns, validation errors).\n    *   Leverage the monitoring solutions established in Task 12 to collect and analyze security logs.\n    *   Configure alerts for critical security events, such as multiple failed login attempts, unusual traffic spikes, or error rate thresholds being exceeded.\n\n## Security Checklist (From Backlog)\n- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning\n- [ ] Container security scanning (DEFERRED - depends on Docker implementation)\n- [ ] Secure default configurations\n- [ ] Input validation hardening\n- [ ] Authentication and authorization review\n- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit\n\n## Acceptance Criteria (From Backlog)\n- [ ] Complete security audit of all components\n- [ ] Implement secure configuration management\n- [ ] Set up proper secrets management\n- [ ] Configure secure API endpoints\n- [ ] Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection\n- [ ] Set up security monitoring and alerting\n\n### Tags:\n- `work_type:security-audit`\n- `work_type:hardening`\n- `component:production-deployment`\n- `component:api-security`\n- `scope:security`\n- `scope:compliance`\n- `purpose:data-protection`\n- `purpose:risk-reduction`",
