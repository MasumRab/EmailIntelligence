        "details": "### Approach\nUse GitPython for repository access, implement efficient commit traversal algorithms, cache results for performance.\nRationale: GitPython provides reliable access to git data, efficient algorithms ensure performance, caching reduces redundant operations.\n\n### Code Structure\n\nsrc/\n  branch_analysis/\n    __init__.py\n    analyzer.py\n    models.py\n    utils.py\n    config.py\ntests/\n  test_branch_analysis.py\n  test_models.py\n\n\n### Key Implementation Steps\n1. 1. Identify the branches that need analysis using git branch commands\n2. Extract metadata for each branch including commit history, last activity, and relationships\n3. Apply the branch analysis algorithms to determine optimal alignment targets\n4. Document findings in the appropriate tracking systems\n   ```\n   ```python\n# Example implementation\ndef example_function(param: str) -> dict:\n    return {\"result\": param}\n```\n   ```\n\n2. 2. Process branch data using established algorithms, validate results against expected format, store in designated location\n   ```\n   ```python\n# Example implementation\ndef example_function(param: str) -> dict:\n    return {\"result\": param}\n```\n   ```\n\n### Integration Points\nPass analysis results to alignment engine, update status tracking, trigger downstream processes\n\n### Configuration Requirements\nUpdate config.yaml with new parameters, add environment variables, modify access controls\n\n### Migration Steps (if applicable)\n1. Backup current configuration 2. Update dependencies 3. Run migration script 4. Validate results 5. Update documentation",
