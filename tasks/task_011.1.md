# Task 011.1: Define Validation Scope and Tooling

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity:** 5/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Parent:** Task 011: Create Comprehensive Merge Validation Framework

## Sub-subtasks Breakdown

### 1.1: Execute Task
- Complete 011.1: Define Validation Scope and Tooling
- Verify completion
- Update status



---

## Purpose

Define validation layers and select appropriate tools for the merge validation framework.

---

## Details

Research and document validation tools for each layer.

### Validation Layers

| Layer | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Architectural | ruff, flake8, mypy | Static analysis |
| Functional | pytest | Unit/integration tests |
| Performance | locust, pytest-benchmark | Benchmarking |
| Security | bandit, safety | SAST, dependency scan |

### Output

Create `validation_framework_design.md` with:
- Tool selection rationale
- Configuration requirements
- Expected output formats
- Threshold definitions

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Tools selected for all layers - Verification: [Method to verify completion]
- [ ] Configuration documented - Verification: [Method to verify completion]
- [ ] Thresholds defined - Implementation passes all validation checks and meets specified requirements - Verification: [Method to verify completion]
- [ ] Design document complete - Verification: [Method to verify completion]
