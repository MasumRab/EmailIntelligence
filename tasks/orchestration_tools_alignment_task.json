  "details": "This task leverages the convenient naming of orchestration-tools branches to perform targeted alignment operations:\n\n1. **Identify Orchestration-Tools Branches**: Use `git branch -r | grep orch` to identify all branches with 'orchestration-tools' in their name\n2. **Catalog Branch Variants**: Create a comprehensive list of orchestration-tools branches including:\n   - origin/orchestration-tools\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-changes\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-changes-2\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-changes-4\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-consolidated\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-consolidated-clean\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-consolidated-temp\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-launch-refractor\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-stashed-changes\n   - origin/orchestration-tools-temp\n   - And others with 'orchestration-tools' in the name\n\n3. **Analyze Content and Determine Target**: For each orchestration-tools branch, analyze its content to determine its intended target (main, scientific, or self-consolidation)\n4. **Apply Branch Bloat Reduction**: Clean up any bloated directories, duplicate documentation, or incomplete migrations specific to these orchestration branches\n5. **Execute Targeted Alignment**: Use the established alignment framework (Tasks 74-83) to align each orchestration-tools branch to its appropriate target\n6. **Validate Orchestration Functionality**: After alignment, specifically verify that orchestration tools (launch scripts, validation tools, etc.) are functional\n7. **Update Orchestration Documentation**: Ensure all orchestration documentation is properly maintained and aligned\n\nThis task takes advantage of the convenient naming pattern to systematically address orchestration branch alignment, which is critical for the overall platform stability.",
  "testStrategy": "Verification involves:\n1. Successful identification and catalog of all orchestration-tools* branches\n2. Correct determination of target branch for each orchestration branch\n3. Successful alignment of each branch to its target\n4. Proper cleanup of bloat from orchestration branches\n5. Validation that orchestration tools are functional after alignment\n6. Confirmation that no destructive conflicts were introduced during alignment\n7. Documentation updated to reflect alignment status of orchestration branches",
