**Title:** Restore and Update Lost Documentation

**Status:** done

**Dependencies:** None

**Priority:** medium

**Description:** Restore lost 'AGENTS.md' and workflow documentation from revert operations and update them to reflect the current state.

**Details:**

Utilize version control history (e.g., Git blame, revert commits, or historical branches) to recover the content of `AGENTS.md` and other critical workflow documentation, potentially located in `docs/` or at the project root. Once recovered, review and update the documentation to accurately reflect the current system architecture, agent functionalities, and development workflows. Ensure all relevant changes from the regression recovery are incorporated into the documentation.

**Test Strategy:**

Review the restored documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Verify that all agent definitions and workflow steps are correctly described. Share with key stakeholders or a small group of developers for feedback on usability and accuracy. Ensure all critical information is present and easy to understand.
