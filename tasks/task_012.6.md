### 012.6. Implement Sequential Execution Control Flow for Branches

**Status:** pending  
**Dependencies:** 012.1, 012.4, 012.5  

Develop the core loop that iterates through the branch processing queue, managing the sequential execution of all alignment steps for each selected feature branch.

**Details:**

This central loop will be the primary driver, calling subsequent integration subtasks (e.g., backup, alignment, error checking, validation, documentation) for each branch. It must manage the current branch's context throughout its processing lifecycle.
