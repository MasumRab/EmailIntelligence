  "details": "After completing the core alignment process (Tasks 74-83), complex merge issues will likely remain that need systematic resolution. This task involves creating an ordered, prioritized list of files that will require attention, organized to ensure foundational issues are addressed first in proper architectural sequence.\n\nThe list should be organized as follows:\n\n**CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL FILES (Address First):**\n- Core infrastructure files (database.py, config files, dependency management)\n- Entry points and initialization files (main.py, __init__.py, launch.py)\n- Security and authentication modules\n- Global state and singleton pattern files\n- Core data models and schemas\n\n**ARCHITECTURAL FOUNDATIONS (Address Second):**\n- Core orchestration and coordination modules\n- Communication protocols (API routes, messaging)\n- Core service implementations\n- Data access layer components\n- Error handling and logging infrastructure\n\n**BUSINESS LOGIC COMPONENTS (Address Third):**\n- Core business logic modules\n- Feature-specific implementations\n- AI/ML model integration components\n- Data processing pipelines\n\n**INTEGRATION POINTS (Address Fourth):**\n- Cross-module communication\n- External service integrations\n- Third-party API connections\n\n**UTILITY AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS (Address Fifth):**\n- Helper functions and utilities\n- Test utilities\n- Documentation and configuration files\n\n**USER INTERFACE COMPONENTS (Address Sixth):**\n- Frontend integration points\n- UI-specific logic\n- Styling and asset files\n\nEach file/grouping should include:\n- Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n- Type classification\nn- Estimated complexity\n- Dependencies on other files\n- Recommended resolution approach\n\nThe list should be ordered to ensure that when a developer or AI assistant begins resolving post-alignment merge issues, they address the most foundational and critical files first, following the architectural direction established during the alignment process.",
  "testStrategy": "The output should be a comprehensive, ordered list that can be used as a roadmap for resolving post-alignment merge issues. The list should be validated by checking that: 1) Critical foundational files appear first in the order, 2) Files are properly categorized by type and criticality, 3) Dependencies between files are respected in the ordering, 4) The order follows architectural best practices (foundational components before dependent ones), 5) The recommended resolution approaches are practical and achievable.",
