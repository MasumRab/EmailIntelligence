## Developer Experience Improvements

### Before Integration
❌ Developers had to:
- Open task-75.X.md for specification
- Cross-reference HANDOFF_75.X_*.md for implementation guidance
- Search multiple documents for test cases
- Find git commands in separate references
- Piece together complete understanding from multiple sources

**Time Cost:** 8-10 hours per task spent on cross-referencing

### After Integration
✓ Developers now:
- Open task-75.X.md and find EVERYTHING
- Follow step-by-step implementation checklist
- Use concrete test case examples immediately
- Copy-paste git commands ready to use
- See all configuration parameters clearly
- Understand performance targets precisely
- Identify dependencies explicitly
- Have complete context at point of use

**Time Saved:** 8-10 hours per task spent on productive implementation

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. **Developers can start Tasks 75.1-75.3** immediately (no dependencies)
2. **Follow implementation checklists** from each subtask section
3. **Use test case examples** as baseline for validation
4. **Copy-paste git commands** from technical references

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Task 75.4** can start once 75.1-75.3 are complete
2. **Tasks 75.5-75.6** follow in dependency sequence
3. **Full pipeline** operational by end of Stage One
4. **Downstream tasks** (79, 80, 83, 101) can begin integration

### Medium Term (Future Sprints)
1. **Tasks 75.7-75.8** provide visualization and testing
2. **Task 75.9** finalizes framework for production
3. **Task 100** deploys framework to main system
