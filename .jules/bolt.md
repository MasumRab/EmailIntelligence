## 2026-01-18 - [Optimized Database Search Caching]
**Learning:** `search_emails_with_limit` in `DatabaseManager` was extremely slow (O(N*C)) due to checking disk content for every email on every search. Adding query result caching in `EnhancedCachingManager` and invalidating it on data updates reduced repeated search time from ~0.1s to ~0.00001s (~8000x speedup).
**Action:** When optimizing read-heavy operations with expensive filters (like disk I/O), always consider caching the *result* of the query, not just the individual items, and ensure proper invalidation on writes.

## 2026-01-24 - [Batched Smart Filter Updates]
**Learning:** `SmartFilterManager.apply_filters_to_email` was performing N database updates and N cache invalidations for N matching filters, causing unnecessary overhead. Consolidating updates into a single batch operation reduced DB roundtrips and cache thrashing.
**Action:** Always batch database updates (especially `UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (...)`) and cache invalidations when processing multiple items in a single logical operation.

## 2026-02-03 - [Optimized Memory Cache Backend]
**Learning:** `MemoryCacheBackend` used a List for `_access_order` and `remove()`/`pop(0)` for LRU, resulting in O(N) operations. This caused massive slowdowns (200x slower at 20k items). `OrderedDict` provides O(1) operations.
**Action:** When implementing LRU caches, always use `OrderedDict` or specialized structures. Avoid `list.remove()` or `list.pop(0)` in hot paths.
