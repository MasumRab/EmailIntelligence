# Task UNKNOWN: Untitled Task

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 40-56 hours
**Complexity:** 7/10
**Dependencies:** 005, 010, 015

## Overview/Purpose
Implement a comprehensive validation integration framework that orchestrates validation checks during and after branch alignment operations. This task provides the integration layer that connects various validation components (error detection, pre-merge validation, comprehensive validation) into a cohesive validation workflow.

**Scope:** Validation integration framework only
**Blocks:** Task 010 (Core alignment logic), Task 018 (End-to-end testing)
