# Task UNKNOWN: Untitled Task

**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 44-60 hours
**Complexity:** 8/10
**Dependencies:** 006, 013, 010

---

## Overview/Purpose
Implement comprehensive rollback and recovery mechanisms for Git branch alignment operations. This task provides the safety net infrastructure that enables restoration to a known good state when alignment operations fail or produce undesirable results.

**Scope:** Rollback and recovery mechanisms only
**Blocks:** Task 010 (Core alignment logic), Task 018 (Validation integration)
