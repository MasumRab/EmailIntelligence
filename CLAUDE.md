## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_workflow_overview()` tool to load the tool-oriented overview (it lists the matching guide tools).

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:
- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and completion
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
