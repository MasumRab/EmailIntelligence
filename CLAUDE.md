# EmailIntelligence - Unified Development Environment

## Project Overview

EmailIntelligence is a full-stack application designed to provide intelligent email analysis and management capabilities. The project combines a Python FastAPI backend for AI/NLP tasks with a React frontend and a Gradio-based UI for scientific exploration.

## General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new frontend code
- Use Python 3.12+ for all backend code
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for JS/TS, snake_case for Python)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful comments for complex business logic

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation in JS/TS/JSON
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Python
- Use double quotes for strings in JS/TS
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays

## Architecture Principles

- Organize code by feature, not by file type
- Keep related files close together
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Task Master AI Instructions
**Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md

## Claude AI Assistant - Context & Guidelines

> **Note:** This file works alongside `AGENTS.md` (generic AI agent instructions). AGENTS.md contains the core Task Master commands and workflows for all AI agents. This file contains only Claude-specific features and integrations.

### MCP Configuration for Claude Code/Claude AI

Configure Task Master MCP server in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "task-master-ai"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "your_key_here",
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** API keys are configured via `task-master models --setup`, not in MCP configuration.

### Claude-Specific Features

#### Context Management

- Use `/clear` between different tasks to maintain focus
- AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md are auto-loaded for context
- Use `task-master show <id>` to pull specific task context when needed

#### Tool Allowlist

Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedTools": [
    "Edit",
    "Bash(task-master *)",
    "Bash(git commit:*)",
    "Bash(git add:*)",
    "Bash(npm run *)",
    "mcp__task_master_ai__*"
  ]
}
```

#### Custom Slash Commands

Create `.claude/commands/taskmaster-next.md`:

```markdown
Find the next available Task Master task and show its details.

Steps:
1. Run `task-master next` to get the next task
2. If a task is available, run `task-master show <id>` for full details
3. Provide a summary of what needs to be implemented
```

#### Parallel Development with Git Worktrees

```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel task development
git worktree add ../project-auth feature/auth-system
git worktree add ../project-api feature/api-refactor

# Run Claude in each worktree
cd ../project-auth && claude    # Terminal 1: Auth work
cd ../project-api && claude     # Terminal 2: API work
```

### Important Differences from Other Agents

#### Direct File Access
Claude Code can directly edit files with native Edit tool (superior to sed/manual editing).

#### Git Integration
Native git commands - no special syntax needed.

#### Session Persistence
Use `/clear` for context isolation between tasks. Multiple Claude Code windows can work on different worktrees simultaneously.

### Recommended Model Configuration

For Claude users:

```bash
# Set Claude as primary model
task-master models --set-main claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
task-master models --set-research perplexity-llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online
task-master models --set-fallback claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

### Your Role with Claude Code

As a Claude assistant with Task Master:

1. **Use MCP tools naturally** - They integrate transparently via `.mcp.json`
2. **Direct file editing** - Use Edit tool for clean, efficient changes
3. **Context isolation** - Use `/clear` between tasks to stay focused
4. **Custom commands** - Leverage `.claude/commands/` for repeated workflows
5. **Parallel worktrees** - Manage multiple features in separate terminals

**Key Principle:** Use native Claude capabilities (Edit, file reading) combined with Task Master MCP for comprehensive task management.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **EmailIntelligenceGem** (21283 symbols, 36176 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/EmailIntelligenceGem/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/EmailIntelligenceGem/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/EmailIntelligenceGem/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/EmailIntelligenceGem/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/EmailIntelligenceGem/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**

> Claude Code users: A PostToolUse hook handles this automatically after `git commit` and `git merge`.
