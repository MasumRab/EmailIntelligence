# Development Session Log

## Session Start
- **Date**: Friday, October 24, 2025
- **Time**: 10:00 AM
- **Session ID**: IFLOW-20251024-001

## Activities Performed

### 1. Initial Setup and Context Review
- Reviewed project structure and documentation
- Examined README.md for project overview
- Checked SESSION_LOG.md for previous session history
- Reviewed QWEN.md for development context
- Analyzed launch.py for environment setup process
- Reviewed development_markers_report.md for priority tasks
- Checked workflow_implementation_plan.md for roadmap
- Examined refactoring_plan.md for ongoing work

### 2. IFLOW.md Creation
- Created IFLOW.md as central documentation for development sessions
- Documented session overview, goals, and project context
- Established framework for session tracking and workflow
- Integrated with existing project documentation practices
- Added development priorities based on markers report

### 3. Priority Task Analysis
- Analyzed the high-priority TODO in `backend/python_backend/email_routes.py:129` regarding workflow selection
- Found that the system currently uses a hardcoded sample workflow instead of selecting based on user preferences or system configuration
- Identified that the system has both legacy and node-based workflows
- Examined the workflow manager and routes to understand how workflows are managed
- Reviewed category service missing methods (update_category and delete_category)

### 4. Implementation of Proper Workflow Selection
- Implemented proper workflow selection in `backend/python_backend/email_routes.py`
- The new implementation:
  1. First tries to use the active workflow from the workflow engine
  2. Falls back to the configured workflow from settings
  3. Uses a default workflow as a last resort
  4. Properly handles cases where no workflow is found
- Removed the hardcoded sample workflow creation
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 5. Implementation of Missing Category Methods
- Added `update_category` and `delete_category` methods to the database manager in `backend/python_backend/database.py`
- The new methods follow the same patterns as existing methods:
  1. `update_category`: Updates category fields while maintaining data integrity and indexes
  2. `delete_category`: Removes category from all indexes and data structures
- Updated the category service in `backend/python_backend/services/category_service.py` to use the new database methods
- Removed the placeholder implementations that returned "not implemented" errors

## Files Modified
- Created IFLOW.md
- Updated SESSION_LOG.md
- Modified backend/python_backend/email_routes.py to implement proper workflow selection
- Modified backend/python_backend/database.py to add update_category and delete_category methods
- Modified backend/python_backend/services/category_service.py to use the new database methods

## Development Priorities Identified
1. **High-Priority TODO**: Implement proper workflow selection in `backend/python_backend/email_routes.py:129` - COMPLETED
2. **Missing Features**: Missing update_category and delete_category methods in category_service.py - COMPLETED
3. **High-Priority FIXME**: Address the FIXME marker in `setup_linting.py:66`
4. **Security Notes**: Several security-related notes in `launch.py` regarding shell injection and hardcoded URLs

## Next Steps
1. Review security notes in launch.py for potential improvements
2. Test the implemented features to ensure they work correctly
3. Update documentation if needed

## Analysis of FIXME in setup_linting.py
After investigation, the "FIXME" in setup_linting.py refers to the pylint configuration that disables warnings about "fixme" comments (W0511 rule). This is intentional behavior to prevent pylint from flagging our own development markers as issues. There is no actual FIXME that needs to be addressed in this file.
