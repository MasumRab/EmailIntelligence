## Sub-subtasks Breakdown

### 1.1: Execute Task
- Complete 002.2: CodebaseStructureAnalyzer
- Verify completion
- Update status



---

## Purpose

Analyze the file structure and code organization of each feature branch to fingerprint its architectural characteristics.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Maps directory structure and file counts per branch
- Identifies language distribution (Python, JS, etc.)
- Detects module boundaries and import patterns
- Generates structural fingerprints for comparison
- Compares against known patterns for main/scientific/orchestration-tools
