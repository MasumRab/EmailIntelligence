**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 28-40 hours
**Complexity:** 8/10/10
**Dependencies:** 004, 006, ~~007~~ (DEPRECATED: Use 002.6 instead), 012, 013, 014, 015, 022
**Blocks:** Task 010 (Complex branch alignment), Task 011 (Validation integration)

## Overview/Purpose

Implement the core orchestrator for multistage branch alignment operations that coordinates with specialized tasks for backup/safety (Task 012), conflict resolution (Task 013), validation (Task 014), and rollback/recovery (Task 015). This task serves as the main entry point for the alignment process while delegating specialized operations to dedicated tasks.

**Scope:** Core alignment orchestration only
**Blocks:** Task 010 (Complex branch alignment), Task 011 (Validation integration)

**Scope:** Implementation of specified functionality
**Focus:** Core functionality implementation
**Value Proposition:** Delivers the required functionality
**Success Indicator:** Task completed successfully
