## How to Proceed

### To Start Implementation (Tasks 75.1-75.3)

1. **Load documentation:**
   ```bash
   cat task_data/task-75.1.md  # CommitHistoryAnalyzer
   cat task_data/task-75.2.md  # CodebaseStructureAnalyzer
   cat task_data/task-75.3.md  # DiffDistanceCalculator
   ```

2. **Use memory system to track progress:**
   ```python
   from .agent_memory.memory_api import create_or_load_memory
   
   memory = create_or_load_memory()
   memory.print_summary()  # See current status
   memory.add_work_log("Started Task 75.1", "Implementing metrics")
   ```

3. **Follow the implementation guide sections:**
   - Developer Quick Reference
   - Subtasks Overview (dependency diagram)
   - Configuration & Defaults
   - Common Gotchas & Solutions
   - Integration Handoff

### To Track Progress

```bash
# View memory system
python .agent_memory/example_usage.py

# Check outstanding todos
python -c "
from .agent_memory.memory_api import create_or_load_memory
memory = create_or_load_memory()
todos = memory.get_outstanding_todos(priority='high')
for todo in todos:
    print(f'TODO: {todo[\"title\"]}')
"
```
