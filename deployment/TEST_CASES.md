Restore script/logic is robust and tested. | Restore process fails, potentially leading to extended downtime or data loss. Backup file is corrupt or incorrect. Incorrect data restored. Significant downtime. Insufficient logging of restore. |
| `python deployment/deploy.py prod restore --file <backup_file_path>` | Data is restored to `prod` from the specified `<backup_file_path>`. High caution advised.       | `prod` services in maintenance. Specified backup file is verified and correct for production.                                                            | Specified file incorrect (e.g. staging backup). Restore fails.                                                                                                                               |

This document provides a baseline for testing `deploy.py`. Specific application details and deployment workflows might necessitate additional test cases.
