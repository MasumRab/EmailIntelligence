			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Email Processing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This is a critical, high-priority task involving debugging and fixing a core business pipeline across multiple, technically diverse modules: email ingestion (I/O, external services), parsing (content extraction, format handling), and AI analysis (model inference, data preprocessing). The interconnectedness of these stages means a fix in one can expose issues in another, increasing debugging complexity. The comprehensive testing requirements (unit, integration, end-to-end) are necessary but add significant effort. The existing 9 subtasks provide a good breakdown, but the inherent technical difficulty remains high."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Migration from 'backend' to 'src/backend'",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a significant structural refactoring, requiring a codebase-wide update of import statements and various configuration files (Docker, CI/CD, pyproject.toml). While tools can automate much of this, identifying and resolving all subtle references and ensuring no regressions are introduced (especially in dynamic imports or non-code files) is challenging. The high potential for subtle errors and regressions, despite the task being well-defined with 5 subtasks, warrants a moderate to high complexity score. Comprehensive regression testing is essential here."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor High-Complexity Modules and Duplicated Code",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for refactoring high-complexity modules, reducing code duplication in the AI engine, and simplifying complex functions. Include subtasks for splitting `smart_filters.py` and `smart_retrieval.py`, abstracting common logic for AI engine duplication, and breaking down `setup_dependencies`, `migrate_sqlite_to_json`, and `run` functions into smaller, single-responsibility methods.",
			"reasoning": "This is a monumental architectural refactoring effort. It involves decomposing two very large, monolithic files (1500+ and 1100+ lines) into smaller, cohesive modules, reducing hundreds of code duplications across AI components, and simplifying functions with high cyclomatic complexity. Each sub-task requires deep understanding of domain logic, careful design of new abstractions (SRP, high cohesion, low coupling), and meticulous execution to maintain functional equivalence. The stringent, test-driven approach with characterization tests and continuous static analysis is crucial but adds significantly to the effort and complexity. This type of deep refactoring often uncovers hidden assumptions and technical debt, making it inherently unpredictable and highly complex."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Merge Validation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a comprehensive merge validation framework for a CI/CD pipeline is a significant DevOps and QA undertaking. It requires integrating and configuring multiple tools for architectural enforcement, functional testing (unit, integration, E2E smoke tests), performance benchmarking, and security scanning. The challenge lies in orchestrating these diverse checks, correctly interpreting their output, configuring branch protection, and robustly testing the validation framework itself (e.g., with deliberate failures). The existing 14 detailed subtasks highlight the extensive scope and effort involved."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Restore Core Backend Infrastructure and Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly critical and complex task given the goal to restore over 100 backend files crucial to the application's core infrastructure across multiple layers (workflow engines, API routes, database, plugin systems). Even with Git-based recovery, re-integrating such a large volume of foundational code in Python and TypeScript, reconstructing dependencies, re-establishing database layers (including migrations), and reactivating complex systems, carries extremely high risk of regressions and subtle errors. The comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E, data integrity, security audit) is mandatory but underscores the deep challenges involved. The clarification that the specified commit didn't cause the loss doesn't reduce the scope of verifying and potentially restoring these core components."

		{
			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Create Integration Migration Guide for Context Control Module Refactoring",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "While a documentation task, this migration guide is critical for developer adoption and stability of a major architectural change within the `context_control` module (static methods to instance-based DI). It requires deep technical understanding to accurately describe breaking changes, provide precise side-by-side code examples, anticipate common pitfalls, and outline an effective testing strategy for the new patterns. The quality of this guide directly impacts developer productivity and the success of the refactoring. Its dependence on completed refactoring (Task 33, 35) and testing (Task 32) means it cannot proceed in isolation."

		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Analysis of launch.py",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly detailed and multi-faceted audit of `src/launch.py`, identified as a critical entry point. It involves scrutinizing security aspects (unsafe functions, injection vectors), analyzing extensive Git history for regressions and technical debt, mapping complex import dependencies (including circular imports), and identifying deviations from project architectural standards and coding style. The combination of manual code review with multiple static analysis and Git history tools, and the subsequent interpretation of findings, requires significant expertise and effort across several domains. The 8 detailed subtasks clearly outline the breadth of this complex analytical work."
