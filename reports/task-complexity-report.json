			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Recover Lost Backend Modules and Features",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks are sufficiently detailed for this task. Proceed with generating detailed steps for each of the 5 subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex Git forensics to identify and recover potentially large, lost code modules. The challenge lies in accurately pinpointing the correct versions of files, merging them back into the current codebase without regressions, and ensuring all dependencies are met. The existing subtasks provide a clear, logical progression, breaking down the Git-specific recovery steps and the subsequent integration and verification."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Migration from 'backend' to 'src/backend'",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for the 'Backend Migration from 'backend' to 'src/backend'' task. Focus on distinct stages: directory movement, Python import statement updates, configuration file adjustments (Docker, CI/CD, pyproject.toml), and final validation/cleanup, including ensuring `__init__.py` files are present.",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this task is a broad architectural change affecting potentially hundreds of files across multiple layers (code, build, CI/CD). The primary complexity comes from the high risk of missing references or introducing subtle path-related bugs. Automating the find-and-replace helps, but manual verification of config files and thorough regression testing is critical. Breaking it into stages for directory, code, and config changes will help manage this complexity."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Security: RBAC, MFA, Session Management, and Auditing",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for 'Implement Enhanced Security: RBAC, MFA, Session Management, and Auditing'. Break down the task by each security feature (RBAC, MFA, Session Management, Audit Logging), and include distinct subtasks for design, implementation, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and security review).",
			"reasoning": "This task is exceptionally complex as it encompasses four major security features, each requiring significant design, implementation, and rigorous testing. RBAC, MFA, session management, and audit logging all involve modifying core authentication flows, user models, and potentially every sensitive endpoint. Interactions between these features must be carefully designed to avoid vulnerabilities. The security implications make correctness paramount, demanding extensive development and testing effort, justifying a high complexity score and numerous subtasks."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor High-Complexity Modules and Duplicated Code",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for 'Refactor High-Complexity Modules and Duplicated Code'. Create subtasks for preparing the refactoring (test coverage/tool setup), individual module splitting (`smart_filters.py`, `smart_retrieval.py`), general duplication reduction, and individual function simplifications (for `setup_dependencies`, `migrate_sqlite_to_json`, `run`).",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring large, high-complexity, and duplicated code in core AI modules presents significant challenges. The modules (`smart_filters.py`, `smart_retrieval.py`) are extensive, and functions have high cyclomatic complexity, making modification risky. The main difficulty lies in understanding intertwined logic, carefully extracting cohesive units, and ensuring no regressions are introduced. Adequate test coverage and static analysis tools are crucial for success, making it a high-effort, high-risk task."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Align Feature Branches with Scientific Branch",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks are sufficiently detailed for this task. Proceed with generating detailed steps for each of the 8 subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the sheer number of feature branches (6+) and the critical dependency on Tasks 1, 2, 3, and 4, which introduce massive architectural and functional changes to the `scientific` branch. Merging these changes into divergent feature branches will inevitably lead to numerous and intricate merge conflicts, particularly with import path changes (Task 2) and security enhancements (Task 3). Careful conflict resolution and extensive post-merge validation for each branch are essential."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Align feature-notmuch-tagging-1 Branch with Scientific Branch",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for 'Align feature-notmuch-tagging-1 Branch with Scientific Branch'. Focus on: initial merge and conflict resolution with `scientific`, integrating specific NotmuchDataSource enhancements (CRUD), AI analysis, SmartFilterManager connection, tag mapping, error reporting/monitoring, security updates, and comprehensive testing.",
			"reasoning": "This is an extremely complex task due to merging a substantial feature branch (AI analysis, smart tagging, full CRUD, database changes) into a `scientific` branch that has just undergone significant architectural changes (Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4). The depth of new functionality in `feature-notmuch-tagging-1` combined with the potential for massive, deep merge conflicts from `scientific` creates an exceptionally high risk of regressions and requires extensive integration effort and rigorous testing. This task combines both large-scale feature integration and complex merge resolution."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Merge Validation Framework",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks are sufficiently detailed for this task. Proceed with generating detailed steps for each of the 8 subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Building a comprehensive merge validation framework involves significant infrastructure development. It requires integrating various static analysis, testing, and performance tools into a CI/CD pipeline, establishing baselines, and enforcing strict quality gates. The technical challenges lie in setting up robust test environments, defining accurate performance thresholds, and ensuring the framework reliably captures and reports all validation aspects before allowing merges to main. The existing subtasks break down this ambitious project effectively."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update Setup Subtree Integration in Scientific Branch",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks are sufficiently detailed for this task. Proceed with generating detailed steps for each of the 6 subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing `git subtree` operations can be complex and error-prone, especially when replacing existing code and reconciling branch-specific modifications. This task requires a strong understanding of Git internals, careful execution of commands, and meticulous review to ensure no data loss or corruption. Identifying the correct subtree components and correctly re-applying `scientific`-specific logic after the initial subtree integration adds significant complexity beyond a simple merge or rebase."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Align import-error-corrections Branch with Main Branch",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks are sufficiently detailed for this task. Proceed with generating detailed steps for each of the 8 subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "While a standard Git rebase operation, the specific nature of the `fix/import-error-corrections` branch (dealing with import paths) combined with the likelihood of `main` having undergone significant structural changes (e.g., Task 2's migration) suggests that many, potentially complex, import-related conflicts will arise. Resolving these conflicts correctly is critical to avoid runtime errors, making this more challenging than a typical rebase. The existing subtasks are well-structured for this process."
