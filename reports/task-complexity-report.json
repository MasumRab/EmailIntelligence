It requires robust error handling, user prompts for manual resolution, integration with error detection scripts (Task 76), and a careful push strategy. The critical nature of maintaining clean Git history and ensuring safety makes this a high-complexity scripting task. The existing description clearly outlines several distinct phases of development for this utility."

It requires handling concurrency (e.g., `ThreadPoolExecutor`) for Git operations, grouping branches by target, integrating multiple other tools (Tasks 75, 76, 77, 78), and implementing robust error handling and logging. The safety aspect of parallel Git operations and managing potential conflicts across multiple branches concurrently makes this a very challenging architectural and implementation task. The existing subtasks outline distinct, complex areas for this framework."

It requires modifying the core alignment logic to invoke these external tools, interpret their results, and halt the alignment process on failure. The challenge lies in robust integration, error handling, and ensuring seamless feedback within a complex, potentially parallel, workflow. This is a high-complexity integration task."

The goal is to make these difficult merges manageable for a single developer, requiring sophisticated scripting and workflow design, making it a high-complexity task."

It requires setting up a dedicated test suite that simulates complex Git environments, executes the full alignment workflow (Tasks 75-80), and generates detailed reports.

This requires systematic identification of problem files, classification by criticality and type, and thorough dependency analysis to ensure a proper architectural resolution order.
