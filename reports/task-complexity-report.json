			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Email Processing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify failing tests or broken components across email ingestion, parsing, and AI analysis stages. Create a detailed implementation plan for each fix, focusing on isolated issues first, then verify the entire pipeline end-to-end. Provide specific component names and error types for each stage.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-priority debugging and fixing task across three critical and interconnected components: email ingestion, parsing, and AI analysis. Debugging existing broken code, especially within a pipeline where issues can cascade, is often more complex and time-consuming than greenfield development. The AI analysis component may involve complex machine learning models, adding another layer of difficulty. End-to-end verification requires meticulous attention to data flow and inter-component communication, significantly increasing the complexity."

			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Backend Migration from 'backend' to 'src/backend'",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for migrating files, updating all Python import statements across the codebase, modifying diverse configuration files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, CI/CD, pyproject.toml), and performing comprehensive regression testing to ensure no functionality is broken.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a large-scale refactoring that, while mechanical in nature (moving files, find-and-replace for imports), carries significant risk due to its breadth. Updating import statements across potentially hundreds of Python files, and modifying various configuration file formats (Python, YAML, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions) introduces many potential points of failure. A single missed reference or incorrect path could break the entire application, necessitating thorough regression testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor High-Complexity Modules and Duplicated Code",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the refactoring of 'smart_filters.py' and 'smart_retrieval.py' into concrete steps for module splitting, specifying new module names and responsibilities. Detail the process for creating characterization tests before refactoring, performing incremental changes, and validating with static analysis metrics.",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring large, high-complexity modules and reducing code duplication without introducing regressions is an inherently difficult task. It requires a deep understanding of the existing codebase, careful architectural design for the new modules, and meticulous incremental changes. The explicit requirement for characterization tests (golden master) and continuous, iterative testing after each small change is the correct but demanding approach. Maintaining or improving performance while refactoring adds another layer of challenge."

		{
			"taskId": 38,
			"taskTitle": "Comprehensive Analysis of launch.py",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for conducting a comprehensive audit of `src/launch.py`, including detailed steps for identifying security concerns (e.g., unsafe function calls, injection vulnerabilities), evaluating regression risks via Git history analysis, mapping import dependencies, and assessing implementation inconsistencies.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a comprehensive audit of a critical entry point (`src/launch.py`), requiring a deep dive into its security posture, historical evolution, dependencies, and adherence to coding standards. While primarily analytical, it demands specialized knowledge in security analysis, Git forensics, and static code analysis. Synthesizing information from various tools and manual reviews into actionable insights is a non-trivial effort."

		{
			"taskId": 71,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Static Analysis for Circular Import Detection",

			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for integrating static analysis for circular imports, including tool selection and configuration, initial codebase scan and documentation of existing cycles, resolution of identified cycles, and setting up CI/CD checks to prevent future occurrences.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating a static analysis tool for circular import detection is a moderately complex task. The primary challenges lie in selecting the most appropriate tool, accurately configuring it for the project's specific needs (minimizing false positives/negatives), and integrating it smoothly into the CI/CD pipeline. The initial phase of identifying and potentially resolving *existing* circular imports might also require minor refactoring, adding to the effort."
