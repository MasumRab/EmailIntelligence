			"taskTitle": "Refactor High-Complexity Modules and Duplicated Code",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 28,
			"expansionPrompt": "The existing subtasks provide a good granular breakdown for this complex refactoring task. No further expansion is immediately recommended.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves extensive, intricate refactoring of critical, large, and complex modules (`smart_filters.py`, `smart_retrieval.py`) and functions, combined with a significant effort to reduce code duplication across the AI engine. The explicit requirement for a rigorous, test-driven approach, including the creation of characterization tests for potentially untested legacy code, significantly increases initial setup and ongoing verification effort. Identifying correct module boundaries, abstracting common patterns, and safely breaking down highly complex functions without altering external behavior demands deep architectural understanding, meticulous execution, and continuous validation. The number of explicit subtasks (28) already reflects this inherent complexity, indicating a multi-stage, high-impact effort crucial for the long-term maintainability and stability of the system. The impact of this task is widespread across the backend, making it highly critical and complex."

			"taskTitle": "Improve Task Management with Advanced Testing Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 11,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the existing subtasks to include granular steps for: 1) Modifying Task Master's data model and API for testing requirements and branch associations. 2) Updating the `.github/workflows/main.yml` to parse and report detailed test results and branch types. 3) Implementing backend logic in Task Master to consume CI/CD results and enforce validation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires significant modifications to both the Task Master AI system's backend and its integration with the CI/CD pipeline. It involves extending data models, modifying APIs/UIs for task creation, and critically, enhancing GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) to perform branch-specific validation and feed detailed test results back. Integrating with the `scientific` branch's specialized testing frameworks adds another layer of specific technical challenges. Each of the existing subtasks is substantial and warrants further breakdown to cover data model changes, CI/CD modifications, and backend integration logic. The risk of misconfiguring CI/CD or incorrectly parsing test results is notable, impacting development workflow reliability."
