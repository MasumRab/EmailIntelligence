			"reasoning": "This task involves a high-impact structural change across potentially many files and configuration types. While conceptually simple (move and rename), ensuring all references are correctly updated and validated across the entire project (Python imports, Dockerfiles, CI/CD, pyproject.toml) requires meticulous attention. Comprehensive regression testing is absolutely critical, making the potential for subtle bugs and the validation effort significant. The existing description is quite detailed, so further subtask expansion beyond what's specified isn't necessary for initial planning."

			"reasoning": "This is a major refactoring effort targeting critical, high-complexity components and significant code duplication. It involves deeply understanding existing logic to safely extract methods, classes, and modules while preserving external behavior. The sheer size of the files (`1598`, `1198` lines) and high cyclomatic complexity scores (`21`, `17`, `16`) indicate intertwined logic and potential for difficult, regression-prone changes. A robust test-driven approach with characterization tests is essential but also adds to the initial setup complexity."

The need to restore \"over 100 backend files\" spanning critical components like workflow engines, API routes, and database layers, coupled with the \"destructive revert\" context, makes it extremely complex. It involves intricate Git operations, dependency reconstruction across multiple ecosystems (Python, Node.js/TypeScript), re-integration of database layers including schema migrations, and reactivation of core application logic. The potential for subtle bugs, performance degradation, and security vulnerabilities is high, necessitating rigorous multi-level testing and extensive code review.

Eliminating implicit global dependencies, designing and implementing a robust, thread-safe config factory pattern, and modifying `ContextController` for explicit dependency injection requires deep understanding of the codebase and careful execution. The need to ensure thread safety under concurrent access, rigorously test for race conditions, and update all call sites further elevates its complexity.

Identifying these issues, especially within a critical and already refactored module (`context_control`), requires specialized static analysis. Resolving them demands careful architectural decisions, potentially involving module restructuring, dependency inversion, or judicious use of lazy imports, all of which carry a risk of introducing new bugs. Implementing preventative safeguards (pre-commit hooks, CI/CD checks) is also complex, ensuring future code quality. The comprehensive verification steps are essential due to the subtle nature of import-related issues. The provided subtasks are well-structured for this effort."

			"reasoning": "This task is a major API refactoring that introduces a fundamental change in how email profiles are managed (ID-based vs. path-based). The complexity stems from: 1) Core API Redesign: Implementing new CRUD operations for an ID-based system. 2) Meticulous Backward Compatibility: Deprecating old methods while ensuring they still function and emit clear warnings, which requires careful delegation. 3) Robust Export/Import: Developing utilities for handling custom file paths outside the manager's default storage. 4) Documentation: Clearly articulating the new serialization format and a migration path. The task is highly intertwined with data persistence and relies on the Pydantic V2 upgrade (Task 28). Extensive unit and integration testing is crucial to prevent data corruption or regressions.

			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for integrating an AI insights engine with the dashboard, including enhancing the AI engine to generate actionable email management recommendations, exposing these AI-generated insights via new endpoints in the Dashboard API, designing and implementing new UI components in Gradio to display insights, leveraging existing AI model management for efficient resource use, and comprehensively testing the accuracy, relevance, and scalability of the AI insights.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating sophisticated AI capabilities directly into the dashboard, making it moderately to highly complex. The core challenge lies in enhancing the AI engine to generate *actionable* and *relevant* insights (e.g., email categorization, workflow suggestions), which is a non-trivial AI/ML engineering problem. Beyond the AI aspect, it requires designing new API endpoints to expose these insights (building on Task 46), and implementing new, potentially interactive, UI components in Gradio to effectively display them. Ensuring proper AI model management and validating the insights' quality and scalability are critical."

			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for improving testing infrastructure and code quality, including replacing bare `except` clauses and implementing proper error handling, adding comprehensive type hints across the codebase, establishing and enforcing code coverage targets with `pytest-cov`, developing security-focused negative test cases, refactoring large NLP modules into smaller units, and reducing code duplication and high-complexity functions using static analysis tools.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a broad and impactful initiative combining significant testing infrastructure improvements with extensive code quality refactoring. It involves systematically addressing anti-patterns like bare `except` clauses, adding comprehensive type hints across a potentially large codebase, establishing and enforcing code coverage, and developing security-critical negative test cases. Simultaneously, it requires major code refactoring: breaking down large, complex NLP modules, reducing code duplication, and simplifying high-complexity functions. The sheer scope and the potential for regressions across both functional and non-functional aspects make this a highly complex task."

			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate subtasks for implementing centralized error handling with consistent error codes, including defining a standardized JSON error response format and an enumeration of application-specific error codes, implementing a global FastAPI exception handler to catch and format errors, refactoring existing `try-except` blocks to leverage the centralized system, ensuring all API endpoints return consistent error responses, and integrating robust logging for all error types.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a fundamental architectural improvement that impacts error handling across the entire FastAPI application. Designing a consistent, structured error response format with application-specific error codes is crucial but requires careful definition. Implementing a global exception handler and systematically refactoring existing `try-except` blocks to leverage this centralized mechanism is complex due to its widespread impact. Ensuring no sensitive information is leaked in production and integrating robust error logging are critical security and operational considerations, making this a moderately complex and high-impact task."
