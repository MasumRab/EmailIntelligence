# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user is working on the Email Intelligence project, a sophisticated email analysis application with a multi-service architecture consisting of Python FastAPI backend, Gradio UI for scientific development, TypeScript Node.js backend, and React frontend.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Python 3.12.x, Node.js 18.x+, and Git for development
- Architecture includes: Python backend (FastAPI), Gradio UI, TypeScript backend (Node.js), and React frontend (Vite)
- Dependencies managed via pyproject.toml (Python) and package.json (Node.js) with uv package manager
- The launch.py script serves as a unified launcher for environment setup and service management
- The codebase currently contains multiple merge conflicts marked with "<<<<<<< HEAD" markers across many files
- Data storage uses local file-based storage in backend/python_backend/data/ and SQLite databases

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive QWEN.md documentation for the project
- Identified multiple files with merge conflicts containing "<<<<<<< HEAD" markers
- Discovered the project has a complex multi-service architecture with Python, TypeScript, and React components
- Found that the launch.py script has merge conflicts that need resolution before proper operation
- Located key directories: backend/, client/, server/, shared/, and backend/python_nlp/

## Current Plan
- [IN PROGRESS] Identifying all files with merge conflicts using search tools
- [TODO] Resolve merge conflicts in launch.py to ensure proper environment setup
- [TODO] Resolve merge conflicts in other files across the codebase
- [TODO] Re-establish proper git workflow to avoid further conflicts
- [TODO] Verify that the application can run correctly after resolving all conflicts
- [TODO] Ensure all services (Python backend, Gradio UI, TypeScript backend, React frontend) work together properly
