# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop an intelligent email management platform that uses AI and NLP for automatic email analysis, categorization, and organization with a node-based workflow system.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Python 3.12.x, Node.js 18.x+, and Git for development
- Architecture includes: Python backend (FastAPI), Gradio UI, TypeScript backend (Node.js), and React frontend (Vite)
- Dependencies managed via pyproject.toml (Python) and package.json (Node.js) with uv package manager
- The launch.py script serves as a unified launcher for environment setup and service management
- The codebase currently contains multiple merge conflicts marked with "<<<<<<< HEAD" markers across many files
- Data storage uses local file-based storage in backend/python_backend/data/ and SQLite databases

- **Architecture**: FastAPI Python backend, Gradio UI for scientific development, TypeScript Node.js backend, and React frontend
- **Data Storage**: Local file-based storage (JSON/GZipped files) and SQLite for data persistence
- **Key Components**: AI Analysis Engine, Model Manager, Workflow Engine, Performance Monitor, Plugin System, Smart Filters
- **Launcher Script**: `launch.py` serves as the unified entry point for setup and running all services
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `pyproject.toml` with `uv` package manager for Python, and npm for Node.js
- **Code Quality**: Uses Black, isort, Pylint, and MyPy for Python formatting and linting
- **Modular Design**: Supports plugins, workflow management, and performance monitoring
- **Port Configuration**: Python backend on 8000, Gradio UI on 7860, React frontend on 5173

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the project structure and identified core components
- Examined key UI components including Dashboard, EmailList, AIAnalysisPanel, and Sidebar
- Reviewed shared data schemas for email and category management
- Understood the AI analysis capabilities and email categorization features
- Identified the node-based workflow engine implementation

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Understand the existing email filtering and categorization system
2. [TODO] Implement enhanced email filtering UI components
3. [TODO] Develop node-based workflow editor interface
4. [TODO] Integrate advanced filtering capabilities with the AI analysis system
5. [TODO] Create comprehensive filtering options for email management
The Email Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive email analysis application that leverages AI and NLP to automatically analyze, categorize, and manage emails using a microservices architecture with multiple interconnected services.
