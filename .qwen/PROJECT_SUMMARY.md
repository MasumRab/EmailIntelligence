# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user's high-level objective was to analyze the EmailIntelligence project to identify code smells and create a plan to fix them.

## Key Knowledge
- The EmailIntelligence project is an AI-powered email management application combining Python NLP models with a modern React frontend
- The project uses FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and various ML libraries like PyTorch, Transformers, and scikit-learn
- The backend stores data using JSON files for main application data and SQLite for smart filters
- The project includes NLP components for sentiment analysis, topic identification, intent detection, and urgency assessment
- The codebase follows a modular structure with separate directories for backend, frontend, and NLP components
- The project uses a launcher script (launch.py) to handle environment setup, dependency installation, and application startup

## Recent Actions
- Identified multiple code smells in the EmailIntelligence project including circular dependencies, inconsistent exception handling, hard-coded paths, missing type hints, code duplication, large classes violating SRP, inconsistent naming conventions, and global state management issues
- Documented code smells with severity levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Created a comprehensive plan to fix the identified code smells
- Prioritized fixes based on impact and complexity (P1-P4 priority levels)

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Understand the existing email filtering and categorization system
2. [TODO] Implement enhanced email filtering UI components
3. [TODO] Develop node-based workflow editor interface
4. [TODO] Integrate advanced filtering capabilities with the AI analysis system
5. [TODO] Create comprehensive filtering options for email management
