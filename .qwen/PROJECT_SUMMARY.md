# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Set up and fix the Email Intelligence Platform, a comprehensive email analysis application that leverages AI and NLP to automatically analyze, categorize, and manage emails using a microservices architecture with Python (FastAPI), React, and Gradio UI components.

## Key Knowledge
- **Architecture**: Uses Python backend (FastAPI), Gradio UI for scientific development, Node-based workflow engine, React frontend (Vite)
- **Launcher Script**: `launch.py` is the unified launcher for setup and running services
- **Dependencies**: Uses fastapi, pydantic v2, transformers, nltk, gradio, uv for dependency management
- **Database**: Uses local file-based storage (JSON/GZipped files) and SQLite
- **AI/ML**: Leverages AI models for sentiment, intent, topic, and urgency analysis
- **Module Structure**: Backend in `backend/python_backend/`, NLP in `backend/python_nlp/`, frontend in `client/`
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.11-3.13 (currently using 3.12.3)

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Fixed multiple merge conflicts in `launch.py` including missing function definitions and duplicate function issues
- [DONE] Successfully ran `python launch.py --setup` which installed dependencies and configured the virtual environment
- [DONE] Fixed forward reference issue in `models.py` using string annotation for `ActionItem` class
- [DONE] Added missing import for `AdvancedAIEngine` in `ai_routes.py`
- [DONE] Resolved circular import issues by removing non-existent route imports (`action_routes`, `dashboard_routes`)
- [DONE] Fixed service initialization in `main.py` by properly initializing `ModelManager`, `AdvancedAIEngine`, and `GmailAIService`
- [DONE] Corrected database manager initialization with proper startup event handling
- [DONE] Successfully verified application import functionality with all dependencies working

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Complete setup and resolve dependency issues
- [DONE] Fix launch.py script and resolve merge conflicts
- [DONE] Verify application imports and functionality
- [TODO] Set up Gmail API credentials for full email integration
- [TODO] Complete end-to-end functionality testing of the email analysis features
- [TODO] Implement production deployment configurations if needed
- [TODO] Document the workflow for adding new AI models or analysis capabilities
