# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop an intelligent email management platform that uses AI and NLP for automatic email analysis, categorization, and organization with a node-based workflow system.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Python 3.12.x, Node.js 18.x+, and Git for development
- Architecture includes: Python backend (FastAPI), Gradio UI, TypeScript backend (Node.js), and React frontend (Vite)
- Dependencies managed via pyproject.toml (Python) and package.json (Node.js) with uv package manager
- The launch.py script serves as a unified launcher for environment setup and service management
- Data storage uses local file-based storage in backend/python_backend/data/ and SQLite databases
- Key components include AI Analysis Engine, Model Manager, Workflow Engine, Performance Monitor, Plugin System, Smart Filters
- Modular design supports plugins, workflow management, and performance monitoring
- Port configuration: Python backend on 8000, Gradio UI on 7860, React frontend on 5173
- Filtering system enhanced with keyword, sender, recipient, category, date/time, size, and priority-based filtering with complex boolean logic

## Recent Actions
- Resolved local merge issues in the Git repository by performing a successful merge with the remote branch
- Identified and analyzed four untracked files representing a comprehensive dynamic AI model management system
- Added these files to the repository after confirming they provide valuable functionality for model lifecycle management
- Files include model management initialization, dynamic model manager implementation, model registry system, and API routes
- Successfully committed and pushed the changes to the remote scientific branch
- Enhanced filtering capabilities integrated with the AI analysis system
- Created AdvancedFilterPanel UI component for complex filter creation
- Developed sophisticated filtering with keyword, sender, recipient, category, date/time, size, priority-based filtering and complex boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT operations)
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for enhanced filtering system
- Added documentation for the new filtering capabilities

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Understand the existing email filtering and categorization system
2. [DONE] Implement enhanced email filtering UI components
3. [DONE] Develop node-based workflow editor interface
4. [DONE] Integrate advanced filtering capabilities with the AI analysis system
5. [DONE] Create comprehensive filtering options for email management
6. [DONE] Add dynamic AI model management system to the codebase
7. [IN PROGRESS] Continue development of the node-based workflow engine
8. [TODO] Expand AI analysis capabilities with additional model types
9. [TODO] Implement plugin system for extensibility
10. [TODO] Enhance performance monitoring and optimization features
