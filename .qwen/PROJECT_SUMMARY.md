# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user's high-level objective is to analyze and enhance the Email Intelligence Platform, focusing on identifying missing backend features and ensuring they are properly documented in the project backlog for future development.

## Key Knowledge
- The Email Intelligence Platform is a sophisticated email analysis application with a modular, polyglot architecture including Python FastAPI backend, Gradio UI, Node-based workflow engine, and React frontend
- The system uses a node-based workflow system inspired by ComfyUI, Automatic1111, and Stability-AI frameworks
- Backend components include AI/NLP engine with sentiment, topic, intent, and urgency analysis capabilities
- The architecture follows a modular design with core functionality in `src/core/` and features in `modules/`
- The project uses SQLite for caching and JSON files for primary data storage
- The launcher script `launch.py` handles environment setup and application startup
- Critical missing backend features include dashboard API endpoint, API authentication, and PromptEngineer class for LLM interaction
- The project follows Python code style guidelines with 100-character line length maximum
- Backlog tasks are managed in markdown files in the `backlog/tasks/` directory with proper status and priority tracking

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Conducted comprehensive analysis of the Email Intelligence Platform architecture
- [DONE] Examined main application components including FastAPI backend, Gradio UI, and node engine
- [DONE] Understood AI/NLP engine implementation and its fallback strategies
- [DONE] Explored the node-based workflow system and its security features
- [DONE] Identified missing backend features from backlog and task files
- [DONE] Verified that relevant backend tasks are already integrated in the main branch backlog with proper prioritization
- [DONE] Confirmed that recent commits include critical tasks like implementing dashboard stats endpoint, PromptEngineer class, and API authentication
- [DONE] Analyzed workflow system documentation and implementation plan
- [DONE] Reviewed the refactoring plan addressing code duplication between `src/core` and `backend/python_backend`

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze the current Email Intelligence Platform architecture
2. [DONE] Review the project documentation and structure
3. [DONE] Examine the main application components (FastAPI backend, Gradio UI, Node engine)
4. [DONE] Understand the AI/NLP engine implementation
5. [DONE] Explore the node-based workflow system
6. [DONE] Determine the current state of the application and identify potential improvements
7. [DONE] Identify missing backend features from backlog and task files
8. [DONE] Prioritize identified missing features ahead of backlog migration
9. [DONE] Verify that relevant backend tasks are already integrated in the main branch backlog
