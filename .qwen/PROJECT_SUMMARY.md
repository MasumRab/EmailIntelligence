# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user is working on the Email Intelligence project, a sophisticated email analysis application with a multi-service architecture consisting of Python FastAPI backend, Gradio UI for scientific development, TypeScript Node.js backend, and React frontend.

## Key Knowledge
- The project uses Python 3.12.x, Node.js 18.x+, and Git for development
- Architecture includes: Python backend (FastAPI), Gradio UI, TypeScript backend (Node.js), and React frontend (Vite)
- Dependencies managed via pyproject.toml (Python) and package.json (Node.js) with uv package manager
- The launch.py script serves as a unified launcher for environment setup and service management
- The codebase currently contains multiple merge conflicts marked with "<<<<<<< HEAD" markers across many files
- Data storage uses local file-based storage in backend/python_backend/data/ and SQLite databases

- **Architecture**: FastAPI Python backend, Gradio UI for scientific development, TypeScript Node.js backend, and React frontend
- **Data Storage**: Local file-based storage (JSON/GZipped files) and SQLite for data persistence
- **Key Components**: AI Analysis Engine, Model Manager, Workflow Engine, Performance Monitor, Plugin System, Smart Filters
- **Launcher Script**: `launch.py` serves as the unified entry point for setup and running all services
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `pyproject.toml` with `uv` package manager for Python, and npm for Node.js
- **Code Quality**: Uses Black, isort, Pylint, and MyPy for Python formatting and linting
- **Modular Design**: Supports plugins, workflow management, and performance monitoring
- **Port Configuration**: Python backend on 8000, Gradio UI on 7860, React frontend on 5173

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive QWEN.md documentation for the project
- Identified multiple files with merge conflicts containing "<<<<<<< HEAD" markers
- Discovered the project has a complex multi-service architecture with Python, TypeScript, and React components
- Found that the launch.py script has merge conflicts that need resolution before proper operation
- Located key directories: backend/, client/, server/, shared/, and backend/python_nlp/
- **[COMPLETED]** Created comprehensive QWEN.md documentation file
- **[COMPLETED]** Resolved all previous merge conflicts between multiple branches (feat/modular-ai-platform, feat/modular-architecture, fix/sqlite-paths)
- **[COMPLETED]** Successfully merged modular AI platform features including ModelManager, WorkflowEngine, and PerformanceMonitor
- **[COMPLETED]** Verified repository is in clean state with all conflicts resolved
- **[COMPLETED]** Confirmed pull and push operations are synchronized with remote repository
- **[COMPLETED]** Documented manual setup procedures in SETUP.md, including alternative to automated launcher

## Current Plan
- [IN PROGRESS] Identifying all files with merge conflicts using search tools
- **[DONE]** Add comprehensive QWEN.md documentation file
- **[DONE]** Ensure repository is clean with no merge conflicts
- **[DONE]** Synchronize local and remote repositories
- **[TODO]** Implement additional features for email processing and analysis
- **[TODO]** Improve testing coverage across all components
- **[TODO]** Further enhance the modular architecture with additional plugins
- [TODO] Resolve merge conflicts in launch.py to ensure proper environment setup
- [TODO] Resolve merge conflicts in other files across the codebase
- [TODO] Re-establish proper git workflow to avoid further conflicts
- [TODO] Verify that the application can run correctly after resolving all conflicts
- [TODO] Ensure all services (Python backend, Gradio UI, TypeScript backend, React frontend) work together properly
The Email Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive email analysis application that leverages AI and NLP to automatically analyze, categorize, and manage emails using a microservices architecture with multiple interconnected services.
