# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user's high-level objective is to develop an Email Intelligence Platform that leverages AI for email analysis, classification, and automation, with a focus on using the Qwen Code model for various email intelligence tasks.

## Key Knowledge
- The project is located in `/home/masum/github/EmailIntelligenceQwen`
- The current directory contains various configuration files, reports, and what appears to be a Docker setup
- There are files related to codebase analysis, issue tracking, model downloads, and deployment policies
- The project utilizes Drizzle ORM (evident from `drizzle.config.ts`)
- There are Docker-related files like `docker-compose.yml`
- The project seems to involve AI model integration, particularly with Hugging Face models (evident from `download_hf_models.py`)
- There are various analysis and report files (e.g., `codebase_analysis_report.txt`, `CODEREVIEW_REPORT.md`, `branch_alignment_report.md`)

## Recent Actions
- The user has set up context for the Qwen Code session
- A directory listing was provided showing the current state of the project
- Various analysis tools have been run on the codebase as evidenced by the report files

## Current Plan
- [TODO] Analyze the existing codebase in detail to understand the current implementation
- [TODO] Identify key components and architecture of the Email Intelligence Platform
- [TODO] Review the codebase analysis reports to understand any existing issues or areas for improvement
- [TODO] Set up the development environment and ensure all dependencies are properly configured
- [TODO] Begin implementing or improving the email intelligence features using the Qwen Code model
