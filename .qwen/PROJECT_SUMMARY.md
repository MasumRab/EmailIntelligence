# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Transform the Email Intelligence Platform into a modular, extensible AI processing platform with node-based workflows, inspired by leading AI frameworks like automatic1111, Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI, and comfyanonymous/ComfyUI, while maintaining enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python (FastAPI) backend, Gradio UI, Node.js/TypeScript secondary services, React/Vite frontend
- **Architecture**: Modular plugin system with processing nodes and UI components, model management system, workflow persistence, performance monitoring
- **Key Components**: ModelManager for dynamic AI model loading/unloading, WorkflowManager for saving/loading node-based workflows, PluginManager for extensible functionality, PerformanceMonitor for system metrics
- **API Endpoints**: New `/api/enhanced` routes for models, workflows, performance metrics, and plugins
- **File Structure**: Backend services in `backend/python_backend/`, NLP components in `backend/python_nlp/`, plugins in `backend/plugins/`
- **Python 3.12+** required with specific dependencies managed via pyproject.toml

## Recent Actions

- [DONE] Created workflow persistence system for saving/loading node-based email processing workflows
- [DONE] Enhanced plugin architecture to support UI components with abstract base classes
- [DONE] Developed performance monitoring system with real-time metrics and system stats
- [DONE] Created API routes for enhanced features in `enhanced_routes.py`
- [DONE] Updated Gradio UI with new tabs for model management, workflow management, and performance monitoring
- [DONE] Created sample processing node plugin (`email_filter_node.py`) and UI component plugin (`email_visualizer_plugin.py`)
- [DONE] Updated project initialization files (`setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, `package.json`)
