# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Analyze the EmailIntelligence project for code smells and improve the codebase while preserving all functionality, with a focus on identifying and addressing potential issues in the Python backend, NLP engine, and database management system.

## Key Knowledge
- **Project Type**: AI-powered email management application with Gmail integration
- **Tech Stack**: Python (FastAPI backend), React frontend, NLTK, scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Architecture**: Python backend with NLP processing, JSON file-based storage, React frontend
- **Key Files**: launch.py (launcher), nlp_engine.py (NLP processing), database.py (data management)
- **Storage**: Local JSON file-based storage instead of traditional databases
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.12.x specifically

## Recent Actions
- **Code Analysis Completed**: Identified multiple code smells across the project:
  - Duplicate main() function in launch.py
  - Large classes (NLPEngine, DatabaseManager) doing too many things
  - Hardcoded values and commented-out code in nlp_engine.py
  - Security vulnerabilities (overly permissive CORS, potential path traversal)
  - Dependency issues (unpinned versions in requirements.txt)
  - Performance issues with file-based storage approach
- **File Structure Mapped**: Explored backend/python_backend/, backend/python_nlp/, client/, and configuration files
- **Security Analysis Performed**: Identified CORS configuration and file operation vulnerabilities

## Current Plan
1. [TODO] Fix duplicate main function in launch.py
2. [TODO] Refactor large classes into smaller, more focused modules
3. [TODO] Improve security by tightening CORS policies and validating file paths
4. [TODO] Address dependency issues by pinning versions in requirements.txt
5. [TODO] Optimize database operations for better performance
6. [TODO] Clean up commented-out code and hardcoded values
