# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop an intelligent email management platform that uses AI and NLP for automatic email analysis, categorization, and organization with a node-based workflow system.

## Key Knowledge
- The EmailIntelligence project is an AI-powered email management application combining Python NLP models with a modern React frontend
- The project uses FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and various ML libraries like PyTorch, Transformers, and scikit-learn
- The backend stores data using JSON files for main application data and SQLite for smart filters
- The project includes NLP components for sentiment analysis, topic identification, intent detection, and urgency assessment
- The codebase follows a modular structure with separate directories for backend, frontend, and NLP components
- The project uses a launcher script (launch.py) to handle environment setup, dependency installation, and application startup

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the project structure and identified core components
- Examined key UI components including Dashboard, EmailList, AIAnalysisPanel, and Sidebar
- Reviewed shared data schemas for email and category management
- Understood the AI analysis capabilities and email categorization features
- Identified the node-based workflow engine implementation

## Current Plan
1. [IN PROGRESS] Understand the existing email filtering and categorization system
2. [TODO] Implement enhanced email filtering UI components
3. [TODO] Develop node-based workflow editor interface
4. [TODO] Integrate advanced filtering capabilities with the AI analysis system
5. [TODO] Create comprehensive filtering options for email management

The Email Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive email analysis application that leverages AI and NLP to automatically analyze, categorize, and manage emails using a microservices architecture with multiple interconnected services.
