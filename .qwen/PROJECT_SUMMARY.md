# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The Email Intelligence Platform is a comprehensive email analysis application that leverages AI and NLP to automatically analyze, categorize, and manage emails using a microservices architecture with multiple interconnected services.

## Key Knowledge
- **Architecture**: FastAPI Python backend, Gradio UI for scientific development, TypeScript Node.js backend, and React frontend
- **Data Storage**: Local file-based storage (JSON/GZipped files) and SQLite for data persistence
- **Key Components**: AI Analysis Engine, Model Manager, Workflow Engine, Performance Monitor, Plugin System, Smart Filters
- **Launcher Script**: `launch.py` serves as the unified entry point for setup and running all services
- **Dependencies**: Managed via `pyproject.toml` with `uv` package manager for Python, and npm for Node.js
- **Code Quality**: Uses Black, isort, Pylint, and MyPy for Python formatting and linting
- **Modular Design**: Supports plugins, workflow management, and performance monitoring
- **Port Configuration**: Python backend on 8000, Gradio UI on 7860, React frontend on 5173

## Recent Actions
