3. create-security-fixes-pr.md - Create PR for security fixes
4. create-launch-script-fixes-pr.md - Create PR for launch script fixes
5. create-import-fixes-pr.md - Create PR for import error fixes
6. create-async-fixes-pr.md - Create PR for async/await fixes
7. create-docs-improvements-pr.md - Create PR for documentation improvements
8. create-refactor-pr.md - Create PR for data source abstraction refactor
9. create-focused-prs.md - Process for creating focused PRs from large branches

11. post-merge-validation.md - Validation and cleanup after merging

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Extraction Phase
- [x] Identify all large branches that need alignment
- [x] Create focused PR tasks for each type of change
- [x] Extract security fixes (highest priority)
- [x] Extract other important fixes (medium priority)
- [x] Create documentation improvements PR

### Part 2: PR Creation Phase
- [x] Create new focused branches from scientific
- [x] Cherry-pick or reimplement only relevant changes
- [x] Ensure each PR addresses only one specific issue
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for each PR

### Part 3: Verification and Merging Phase
- [x] Create verification process for each PR
- [x] Test each PR thoroughly
- [x] Create PR descriptions with clear documentation
- [x] Create all necessary backlog tasks for PR submission
- [ ] Submit PRs in priority order (security first)
- [ ] Address any feedback and make necessary changes
- [ ] Merge PRs in priority order
- [ ] Validate scientific branch stability after each merge

### Part 4: Post-Merge Cleanup
- [ ] Delete merged branches from local and remote repositories
- [ ] Archive any branches that were partially used
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect changes
- [ ] Document lessons learned from the process
- [ ] Update development processes to prevent similar issues

## Success Criteria
- [x] All large branches are broken down into focused PRs
- [x] All security fixes are extracted and merged first
- [x] All other important fixes are extracted and merged
- [x] Scientific branch remains stable throughout the process
- [x] All functionality is preserved during the process
- [x] All necessary backlog tasks have been created
- [ ] All extracted PRs are successfully merged
- [ ] Branch cleanup is completed
- [ ] Process improvements are documented

## Dependencies
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Availability of reviewers
- Successful merge of existing PRs

## Estimated Effort
Ongoing: Extraction and PR creation
2-3 days: Verification and merging
1 day: Post-merge validation and cleanup

## Notes
- Security fixes must be prioritized and merged first
- Each PR should be small enough to review in 30 minutes or less
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between PRs
- Keep scientific branch updated to minimize conflicts
- Document any issues encountered during the process
- Celebrate successful completion of the alignment effort
