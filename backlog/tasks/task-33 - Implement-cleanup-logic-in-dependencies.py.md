## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The  statement in  is a placeholder for potential cleanup logic in  blocks within async generators.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Replace  with appropriate cleanup logic
- [ ] #2 Ensure cleanup logic handles resource release correctly
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statements in `get_email_service` and `get_category_service` were introduced as placeholders for *new* cleanup logic, not as replacements for existing code. This task involves defining and implementing any necessary resource release or finalization steps for these services.
