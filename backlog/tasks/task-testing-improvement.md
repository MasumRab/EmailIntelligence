## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Improve the testing infrastructure by fixing bare except clauses, adding missing type hints, implementing comprehensive test coverage, and adding negative test cases for security validation.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All bare except clauses fixed in test files
- [ ] #2 Missing type hints added to all test functions
- [ ] #3 Comprehensive test coverage for all security features
- [ ] #4 Negative test cases implemented for security validation
- [ ] #5 Overall test coverage improved
- [ ] #6 Test code quality enhanced
- [ ] #7 Testing infrastructure improved
- [ ] #8 Automated test coverage reporting set up
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Identify all bare except clauses in test files
2. Replace bare except clauses with specific exception handling
3. Add missing type hints to all test functions
4. Review and improve existing test code quality
5. Analyze current security test coverage
6. Design comprehensive test cases for all security features
7. Implement negative test cases for security validation
8. Add edge case testing for security functionality
9. Identify areas with insufficient test coverage
10. Design additional test cases to improve coverage
11. Implement new tests for uncovered functionality
12. Verify test coverage metrics after implementation
13. Review and update testing documentation
14. Add new testing utilities and helpers as needed
15. Improve test execution performance where possible
16. Set up automated test coverage reporting

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Focus on improving test reliability and maintainability. Ensure new tests follow established patterns and conventions. Consider adding property-based testing for complex validation logic. Regular review of test coverage metrics should be established. Document any new testing patterns or utilities created.
