## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Enhance the AI analysis capabilities by integrating more advanced NLP models and improving accuracy of email classification, sentiment analysis, and intent recognition.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Enhance AI Analysis Capabilities

Improve the accuracy and breadth of AI-powered email analysis features, including topic classification, sentiment analysis, and intent recognition.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement advanced natural language processing techniques
- [ ] Improve topic classification accuracy to >90%
- [ ] Enhance sentiment analysis to detect nuanced emotions
- [ ] Add intent recognition for action items and requests
- [ ] Integrate with external knowledge bases for context awareness
- [ ] Optimize AI models for faster processing
- [ ] Add support for multilingual email analysis

### Implementation Notes
- Review current NLP implementation in `backend/python_nlp/`
- Consider integrating transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa
- Evaluate performance impact on existing workflows
- Ensure backward compatibility with current API
- Update documentation and examples
- Add unit tests for new functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Benchmark current AI models (sentiment, topic classification, intent recognition) on test datasets\n2. Research and evaluate transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) for email analysis\n3. Implement model fine-tuning pipeline for email-specific domains\n4. Create data preprocessing pipeline for email text normalization and feature extraction\n5. Develop ensemble methods combining multiple models for improved accuracy\n6. Implement model versioning and A/B testing framework for model comparison\n7. Add confidence scoring and uncertainty estimation for AI predictions\n8. Optimize model inference performance with quantization and model compression\n9. Create comprehensive evaluation metrics and automated model validation\n10. Update API endpoints to expose new AI capabilities and confidence scores
