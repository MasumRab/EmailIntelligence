## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Enhance the AI analysis capabilities by integrating more advanced NLP models and improving accuracy of email classification, sentiment analysis, and intent recognition.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Enhance AI Analysis Capabilities

Improve the accuracy and breadth of AI-powered email analysis features, including topic classification, sentiment analysis, and intent recognition.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement advanced natural language processing techniques
- [ ] Improve topic classification accuracy to >90%
- [ ] Enhance sentiment analysis to detect nuanced emotions
- [ ] Add intent recognition for action items and requests
- [ ] Integrate with external knowledge bases for context awareness
- [ ] Optimize AI models for faster processing
- [ ] Add support for multilingual email analysis

### Implementation Notes
- Review current NLP implementation in `backend/python_nlp/`
- Consider integrating transformer-based models like BERT or RoBERTa
- Evaluate performance impact on existing workflows
- Ensure backward compatibility with current API
- Update documentation and examples
- Add unit tests for new functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Evaluate and integrate transformer-based models (BERT/RoBERTa) for improved accuracy
- [ ] #2 Improve email classification accuracy by 20%+ on test datasets
- [ ] #3 Enhance sentiment analysis with better context understanding
- [ ] #4 Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints
- [ ] #5 Add comprehensive tests for new AI functionality
- [ ] #6 Update documentation with new AI capabilities and usage examples
