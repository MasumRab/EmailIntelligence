# Backlog Task: Create Focused PRs from Large Branches

## Task ID: task-create-focused-prs-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
This task involves creating focused, manageable PRs from the large branches by breaking them down into smaller, specific changes. Each PR should address one clear issue or feature.

## Target Branches to Break Down

### 1. fix/launch-bat-issues
- Create PR for: Launch script fixes
- Create PR for: (if applicable) related documentation updates

### 2. fix/import-errors-and-docs
- Create PR for: Import error fixes
- Create PR for: Documentation improvements
- Create PR for: (if applicable) code organization improvements

### 3. fix/incorrect-await-usage
- Create PR for: Async/await usage corrections
- Create PR for: (if applicable) related performance improvements

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Branch Creation
1. For each large branch, create new focused branches from current scientific
2. Name branches descriptively (e.g., `fix/launch-script-errors`, `docs/improve-readme`, etc.)
3. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the relevant changes for each focused branch

### Part 2: Code Cleanup
1. Remove any unrelated changes from each focused branch
2. Ensure each branch addresses only one specific issue
3. Clean up commit history for each branch

### Part 3: Testing
1. Ensure each focused branch passes all relevant tests
2. Add new tests if necessary for the changes
3. Verify no regressions are introduced

### Part 4: PR Creation
1. Create GitHub PR for each focused branch
2. Write clear, detailed PR descriptions
3. Include testing instructions and verification steps
4. Link to relevant issues or documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Each large branch is broken into 2-5 focused branches
- [ ] Each focused branch addresses only one specific issue
- [ ] All focused branches pass tests
- [ ] GitHub PRs are created for all focused branches
- [ ] PR descriptions are clear and actionable

## Dependencies
- Previous backlog tasks (align-large-branches-strategy, extract-security-fixes)
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Successful merge of existing PRs

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days: Breaking down branches
1-2 days: Testing and cleanup
1 day: PR creation and documentation

## Notes
- Each PR should be small enough to review in 30 minutes or less
- Focus on making changes easy to understand and verify
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between PRs
- Use consistent naming conventions for branches and PRs
