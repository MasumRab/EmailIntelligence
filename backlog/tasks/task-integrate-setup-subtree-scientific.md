# Task: Integrate Setup Subtree in Scientific Branch

## Description
Integrate the new setup subtree methodology into the scientific branch, allowing the scientific branch to pull updates from the shared setup directory while continuing independent development on scientific features.

## Steps
1. Update launch scripts in scientific branch to work with the new setup subtree structure
2. Create or update a git subtree relationship to pull from the setup directory
3. Test the launch functionality after integration
4. Update documentation to reflect the new process
5. Ensure all CI/CD processes account for the new structure

## Subtasks
- [x] Update scientific branch launch scripts to reference setup subtree
- [x] Test launch functionality from scientific branch after subtree integration
- [x] Update scientific branch documentation to reflect subtree usage
- [x] Update CI/CD configuration in scientific branch to account for subtree
- [x] Verify compatibility with scientific-specific functionality
- [x] Document process for applying setup updates to scientific branch

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Scientific branch can successfully launch the application using setup subtree
- [x] Scientific branch can receive updates from setup subtree
- [x] CI/CD pipeline works correctly with new structure
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new workflow
- [x] No regression in existing scientific functionality

## Task Dependencies
- Setup subtree directory structure created (completed)

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
8 hours

## Status
Completed

## Completion Notes
Successfully implemented subtree integration for scientific branch:
- Added the launch-setup-fixes branch as a subtree in the setup/ directory
- Removed original launch and setup files from root directory
- Created wrapper scripts (launch.py, launch.sh, launch.bat) that forward to the setup subtree
- Created symbolic links for configuration files (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt)
- Removed nested setup directory that was created during subtree addition
- Maintained full backward compatibility with existing references
- All changes pushed to remote scientific branch

The subtree methodology has been implemented and team members can follow the process to integrate
the setup subtree into the scientific branch, allowing for centralized management of launch and setup files
while maintaining branch independence.
