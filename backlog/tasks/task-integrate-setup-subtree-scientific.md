# Task: Integrate Setup Subtree in Scientific Branch

## Description
Integrate the new setup subtree methodology into the scientific branch, allowing the scientific branch to pull updates from the shared setup directory while continuing independent development on scientific features.

## Steps
1. Update launch scripts in scientific branch to work with the new setup subtree structure
2. Create or update a git subtree relationship to pull from the setup directory
3. Test the launch functionality after integration
4. Update documentation to reflect the new process
5. Ensure all CI/CD processes account for the new structure

## Subtasks
- [ ] Update scientific branch launch scripts to reference setup subtree
- [ ] Test launch functionality from scientific branch after subtree integration
- [ ] Update scientific branch documentation to reflect subtree usage
- [ ] Update CI/CD configuration in scientific branch to account for subtree
- [ ] Verify compatibility with scientific-specific functionality
- [ ] Document process for applying setup updates to scientific branch

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scientific branch can successfully launch the application using setup subtree
- [ ] Scientific branch can receive updates from setup subtree
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline works correctly with new structure
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new workflow
- [ ] No regression in existing scientific functionality

## Task Dependencies
- Setup subtree directory structure created (completed)

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
8 hours

## Status
Pending

## Additional Notes
This integration will allow the scientific branch to continue its specialized development while benefiting from centralized setup improvements. Special attention should be paid to ensure scientific-specific dependencies and configurations continue to work with the common launch infrastructure.
