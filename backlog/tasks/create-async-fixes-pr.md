# Backlog Task: Create PR for Async/Await Usage Fixes

## Task ID: task-create-async-fixes-pr-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that extracts async/await usage corrections from the `fix/incorrect-await-usage` branch. This PR should address specific async programming issues without including unrelated changes.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `fix/incorrect-await-usage`
- Create new branch: `fix/async-await-corrections`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Correct usage of await keywords
2. Proper async function implementations
3. Concurrency pattern improvements
4. Resource management in async code

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `fix/incorrect-await-usage` branch for async-related commits
2. Check if these fixes already exist in scientific branch
3. Identify the specific async issues being addressed
4. Document the problems with current async usage

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `fix/async-await-corrections` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the async fixes
3. Ensure changes maintain correct async behavior
4. Add comprehensive tests for the async improvements

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the async issues
2. Document how the fixes address each issue
3. Include testing instructions for async behavior
4. Add performance impact analysis if relevant

### Part 4: Testing
1. Run async-focused tests to ensure correct behavior
2. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. Test edge cases and error conditions in async code
4. Ensure performance is not negatively impacted

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Async/await fixes are extracted into focused PR
- [ ] PR addresses only async-related changes
- [ ] All async tests pass
- [ ] PR description is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] GitHub PR is created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- Current PRs (docs cleanup, search in category) should be merged first
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Security fixes PR should be prioritized first

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days: Analysis and identification
2-3 days: Implementation and testing
0.5 day: Documentation and PR creation

## Notes
- Focus only on async/await fixes, avoid unrelated changes
- Test thoroughly with different async scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any changes to async function signatures
- Coordinate with team members who work with async code
- Ensure error handling is properly implemented
