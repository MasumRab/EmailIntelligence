## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Consolidate the mixed usage of uv and Poetry for dependency management into a single, consistent approach across the entire codebase.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Audit current usage of uv vs Poetry across codebase
- [x] #2 Choose primary dependency management tool based on performance and features
- [x] #3 Update all documentation and scripts to use standardized approach
- [x] #4 Migrate existing configurations to standardized format
- [x] #5 Update CI/CD pipelines to use standardized dependency management
- [x] #6 Add validation to prevent mixed usage in future development
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Audit current dependency management usage across all files\n2. Analyze uv vs Poetry features, performance, and compatibility\n3. Choose the best tool for the project needs\n4. Update all scripts and documentation to use standardized approach\n5. Migrate configurations and ensure consistency\n6. Add validation to prevent future mixed usage
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Standardized on uv as the sole dependency management tool. Removed Poetry references from README, AGENTS.md, launcher_guide.md, deployment_guide.md, and SYSTEM_PACKAGES_README.md. Removed poetry.lock file and added Poetry files to .gitignore. Updated launch.py to remove --use-poetry flag and default to uv. Created validate_dependencies.py script for ongoing validation. Updated documentation to reflect uv-only approach.
