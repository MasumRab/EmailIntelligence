## Workflow Engine Enhancement

Improve the workflow engine with better execution logic, error handling, and performance optimizations to support more complex email processing workflows.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement proper topological sorting for node execution order
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement workflow validation before execution
- [ ] Add support for conditional node execution
- [ ] Optimize memory usage during workflow execution
- [ ] Implement parallel execution for independent nodes
- [ ] Add workflow execution monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Create unit tests for all new functionality

### Implementation Notes
- Review current implementation in `src/core/workflow_engine.py`
- The current `WorkflowRunner.run()` method has a naive implementation that needs to be replaced
- Implement proper graph traversal using the `connections` attribute
- Add validation to check for cycles in the workflow DAG
- Consider using asyncio for parallel execution of independent nodes
- Implement detailed logging for debugging workflow execution
- Add performance metrics collection (execution time, memory usage, etc.)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing workflows
