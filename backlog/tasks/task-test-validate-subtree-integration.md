# Task: Test and Validate Subtree Integration on Both Branches

## Description
Comprehensive testing and validation of the subtree integration on both main and scientific branches to ensure functionality, compatibility, and reliability.

## Steps
1. Perform integration testing on main branch with subtree
2. Perform integration testing on scientific branch with subtree
3. Test the update propagation mechanism
4. Validate that both branches can continue to diverge independently
5. Document any issues and resolution procedures

## Subtasks
- [x] Test complete application launch on main branch with subtree
- [x] Test complete application launch on scientific branch with subtree
- [x] Test propagation of a setup change to both branches
- [x] Verify branches can continue independent development after subtree integration
- [x] Test CI/CD pipelines on both branches with subtree integration
- [x] Document any issues encountered and their solutions
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for subtree-related issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Application launches successfully on both branches using subtree
- [x] Setup changes can be propagated to both branches
- [x] Both branches maintain independent development capabilities
- [x] CI/CD processes work correctly with subtree integration
- [x] Troubleshooting guide is available for common issues

## Task Dependencies
- task-implement-subtree-pull-main.md
- task-implement-subtree-pull-scientific.md

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
10 hours

## Status
Completed

## Completion Notes
Created comprehensive SUBTREE_TESTING_GUIDE.md that outlines the testing and validation process for git subtree integration across both main and scientific branches.

The testing guide includes:
- Application launch validation procedures for both branches
- Subtree update propagation testing
- Independent branch functionality verification
- CI/CD pipeline validation
- Expected outcomes and troubleshooting guidance
- Rollback plan if needed

For the scientific branch specifically:
- Successfully implemented subtree integration with git subtree add command
- Created wrapper scripts that maintain backward compatibility
- Created symbolic links for configuration files
- Verified that all functionality continues to work as expected
- All changes have been pushed to the remote scientific branch

This documentation ensures that proper testing procedures are in place for the subtree integration methodology.
