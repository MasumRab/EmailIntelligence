## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Optimize application performance and implement comprehensive monitoring to ensure efficient operation and quick issue detection.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Performance Optimization and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization for production workloads.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM) implemented
- [ ] Database performance monitoring set up
- [ ] Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Response time monitoring for all endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Alerting configured for performance thresholds

### Performance Targets
- [ ] API response time < 500ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Database query time < 100ms average
- [ ] Memory usage < 80% of available RAM
- [ ] Error rate < 1% of total requests
- [ ] Uptime > 99.9%

### Optimization Tasks
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets
- [ ] Background job optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Implement performance monitoring decorators and metrics collection for API endpoints
- [ ] #2 Add database query optimization and connection management
- [ ] #3 Implement caching for frequently accessed data and AI models
- [ ] #4 Add comprehensive health check endpoints with performance metrics
- [ ] #5 Optimize AI model loading and inference performance
- [ ] #6 Document performance benchmarks and monitoring best practices

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing performance monitoring code (performance_monitor.py, log_performance decorator)\n2. Enhance performance monitoring with detailed metrics collection\n3. Optimize database queries and add connection pooling if needed\n4. Implement caching for data and models\n5. Add comprehensive health check endpoints\n6. Optimize AI model performance\n7. Document performance monitoring and benchmarks
