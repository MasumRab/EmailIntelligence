<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Performance Optimization and Monitoring

Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization for production workloads.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application Performance Monitoring (APM) implemented
- [ ] Database performance monitoring set up
- [ ] Resource usage tracking (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Response time monitoring for all endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Alerting configured for performance thresholds

### Performance Targets
- [ ] API response time < 500ms for 95% of requests
- [ ] Database query time < 100ms average
- [ ] Memory usage < 80% of available RAM
- [ ] Error rate < 1% of total requests
- [ ] Uptime > 99.9%

### Optimization Tasks
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] CDN setup for static assets
- [ ] Background job optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Implement performance monitoring decorators and metrics collection for API endpoints
- [ ] #2 Add database query optimization and connection management
- [ ] #3 Implement caching for frequently accessed data and AI models

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Audit existing performance monitoring in backend/python_backend/performance_monitor.py and src/core/performance_monitor.py\n2. Enhance @log_performance decorator with detailed timing, memory usage, and error tracking\n3. Implement comprehensive metrics collection (response times, throughput, error rates, resource usage)\n4. Add database query optimization: implement connection pooling, query caching, and index optimization\n5. Implement Redis/memory caching for frequently accessed data (email metadata, user sessions, AI model results)\n6. Create /api/health and /api/metrics endpoints with detailed system and performance statistics\n7. Optimize AI model loading with lazy loading, model caching, and GPU memory management\n8. Add performance benchmarking suite and automated performance regression testing\n9. Implement performance alerting and monitoring dashboards\n10. Document performance benchmarks, optimization techniques, and monitoring procedures
