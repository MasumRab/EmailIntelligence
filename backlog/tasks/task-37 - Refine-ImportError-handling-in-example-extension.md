## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The  statement in  is a placeholder for handling  silently. This task is to refine this error handling, potentially adding specific logging or alternative actions.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Replace  with appropriate error logging or fallback mechanism
- [ ] #2 Ensure error handling provides useful debugging information
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statement in the `except ImportError:` block was introduced as a placeholder for silent error handling. This task involves replacing `pass` with more robust error handling, such as logging the error, providing a fallback mechanism, or raising a more specific exception.
