# Task: Update UI Components Architecture in Scientific Branch

## Task ID: task-update-ui-components-architecture

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Todo

## Description
Update the UI components architecture in the scientific branch to align with the more recent interface implementations in the main branch. This includes React frontend, Gradio UI, and dashboard components.

## Target Branch
- Branch: `scientific`
- Based on: Current scientific branch state
- Integration target: Main branch UI architecture

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Update React frontend components to match main branch
2. Align Gradio UI implementation with main branch
3. Update dashboard components to match main branch
4. Ensure consistent API integration patterns

## Action Plan

### Part 1: UI Architecture Assessment
1. Compare UI implementations between branches
2. Identify differences in component architecture
3. Document improvements in main branch UI
4. Assess current UI functionality in scientific branch

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Update React components to match main branch patterns
2. Align Gradio UI with main branch implementation
3. Update dashboard components for consistency
4. Ensure API integration patterns are aligned

### Part 3: Testing
1. Run UI-specific tests for all components
2. Verify React frontend functionality
3. Test Gradio UI components work correctly
4. Validate dashboard displays data as expected

### Part 4: Validation
1. Perform UI functionality checks
2. Run full test suite to catch regressions
3. Validate user experience consistency
4. Document changes for UI developers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] React frontend components aligned with main branch
- [ ] Gradio UI implementation updated and functional
- [ ] Dashboard components consistent with main branch
- [ ] UI tests pass
- [ ] User experience is consistent and functional
- [ ] API integration works as expected
- [ ] PR created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- AI/NLP architecture update completed
- UI component documentation from main branch available

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days: Assessment and implementation
1 day: UI testing
0.5 days: Validation and documentation
0.5 days: PR creation

## Notes
- UI changes can have wide impact, thorough testing is essential
- Ensure responsive design is maintained
- Validate accessibility standards are met
- Consider user experience during transition
