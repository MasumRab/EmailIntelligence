## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The  statement in  of  indicates that it is an abstract method within a protocol that must be implemented by conforming AI engine classes. This task is to ensure concrete implementations provide the necessary logic for email analysis.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Implement  method in conforming AI engine classes
- [ ] #2 Ensure method correctly analyzes email subject and content, and optionally uses database for context
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statement in `analyze_email` of `AIEngineProtocol` indicates that it is an abstract method that must be implemented by concrete AI engine protocol implementations. This task involves ensuring conforming classes provide the necessary logic to analyze email subject and content.
