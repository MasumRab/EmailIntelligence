## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statement in `backend/node_engine/node_base.py` within the abstract `execute` method indicates subclasses must implement this. This file is deprecated. Ensure subclasses implement `execute` or ensure proper removal.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The `pass` statement is replaced with a concrete implementation of the `execute` method in subclasses, or the file is removed.
<!-- AC:END -->
