## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Complete the alignment of database dependency injection with the DatabaseConfig approach to ensure proper configuration management and dependency injection throughout the application.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Add DatabaseConfig class for proper dependency injection
- [x] #2 Modify DatabaseManager.__init__ to accept DatabaseConfig instance
- [x] #3 Make data directory configurable via environment variables
- [x] #4 Add schema versioning and migration tracking capabilities
- [x] #5 Implement security path validation using validate_path_safety and sanitize_path
- [x] #6 Add backup functionality with separate backup directory
- [x] #7 Update file path construction to use config-based paths
- [x] #8 Add validation to ensure directories exist or can be created
- [x] #9 Update DatabaseManager to support both new config-based initialization and legacy initialization
- [x] #10 Create factory functions for proper dependency injection
- [x] #11 Provide backward compatible get_db() function for existing code
- [x] #12 Remove global singleton approach in favor of proper dependency injection
- [x] #13 Test with existing code to ensure backward compatibility
- [x] #14 Update documentation for new configuration options

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
This task has been completed successfully. The database layer now properly supports dependency injection through the DatabaseConfig class and factory functions. Key improvements include:

1. **Proper Dependency Injection**: Replaced global singleton pattern with factory-based approach
2. **Configuration Management**: DatabaseConfig class handles all configuration options with environment variable support
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility through deprecated get_db() function with warnings
4. **Security**: Built-in path validation using validate_path_safety
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for new configuration options and migration guide
6. **Testing**: Updated existing code to use new dependency injection approach

The implementation follows modern software engineering practices and improves testability while maintaining full backward compatibility.
