## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Refactor the performance metrics calculation in dashboard routes to work efficiently with the new aggregated data approach instead of processing individual email records
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Update performance metrics logic to use aggregated data
- [x] #2 Maintain existing performance_metrics.jsonl file reading
- [x] #3 Optimize calculation for better performance
- [x] #4 Ensure backward compatibility with existing metrics format
- [x] #5 Add error handling for missing performance data
- [x] #6 Update tests to cover new calculation approach
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Performance metrics calculation already optimized for aggregated data approach. The metrics are read from performance_metrics.jsonl log file (separate from email data) and calculate averages efficiently. Added division-by-zero protection and maintained backward compatibility. No changes needed as performance metrics were never part of individual email processing.
