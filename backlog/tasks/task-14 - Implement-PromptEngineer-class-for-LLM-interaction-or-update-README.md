## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The README.md mentions a `PromptEngineer` class in `backend/python_nlp/ai_training.py` that suggests capabilities for LLM interaction if developed further. However, this class was not found in the specified location. This task involves either implementing the `PromptEngineer` class with its LLM interaction capabilities or updating the README to accurately reflect the current state of the AI system.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Locate or create the `PromptEngineer` class in the appropriate backend module.
- [x] #2 Implement initial capabilities for LLM interaction within the `PromptEngineer` class (e.g., basic prompt templating, integration with a placeholder LLM service).
- [x] #3 If the class is deemed unnecessary or out of scope, update the README.md to remove the reference to `PromptEngineer` and clarify the AI system\'s current LLM strategy.
- [x] #4 Add basic unit tests for the `PromptEngineer` class if implemented.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented the `PromptEngineer` class in `backend/python_nlp/ai_training.py` with comprehensive LLM interaction capabilities:

**PromptEngineer Class Features:**
- Template registration and management system
- Dynamic prompt generation with variable substitution
- Pre-configured templates for email analysis and system prompts
- Email categorization prompt creation with custom categories
- Error handling for missing templates and variables

**Key Methods:**
- `register_template()`: Add custom prompt templates
- `generate_prompt()`: Generate prompts from templates with variable substitution
- `create_email_categorization_prompt()`: Specialized method for email categorization tasks

**Testing:**
- Unit tests implemented in `tests/test_prompt_engineer.py`
- Tests cover template filling, variable substitution, and prompt execution
- All tests pass successfully with backward compatibility maintained

**README Status:**
- README.md reference to PromptEngineer class remains accurate as the class has been implemented
- No changes needed to README since the class exists as described

The implementation provides a solid foundation for LLM integration while maintaining compatibility with the existing local AI model architecture.
