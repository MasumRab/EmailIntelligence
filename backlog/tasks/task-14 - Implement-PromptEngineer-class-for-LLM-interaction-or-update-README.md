## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The README.md mentions a `PromptEngineer` class in `backend/python_nlp/ai_training.py` that suggests capabilities for LLM interaction if developed further. However, this class was not found in the specified location. This task involves either implementing the `PromptEngineer` class with its LLM interaction capabilities or updating the README to accurately reflect the current state of the AI system.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Locate or create the `PromptEngineer` class in the appropriate backend module.
- [ ] #2 Implement initial capabilities for LLM interaction within the `PromptEngineer` class (e.g., basic prompt templating, integration with a placeholder LLM service).
- [ ] #3 If the class is deemed unnecessary or out of scope, update the README.md to remove the reference to `PromptEngineer` and clarify the AI system\'s current LLM strategy.
- [ ] #4 Add basic unit tests for the `PromptEngineer` class if implemented.
