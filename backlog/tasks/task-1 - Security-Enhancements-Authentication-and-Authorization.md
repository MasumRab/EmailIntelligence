# Task: Security Enhancements - Authentication and Authorization

## Priority
HIGH

## Description
Implement enhanced security features for authentication and authorization based on the actionable insights document.

## Current Implementation
JWT-based authentication with basic authorization.

## Requirements
1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
2. Add multi-factor authentication support
3. Implement session management with automatic expiration
4. Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can be assigned to different roles with specific permissions
- Multi-factor authentication is available as an option
- Sessions automatically expire after a configurable time
- All security-sensitive operations are logged with sufficient context

## Estimated Effort
16 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using OAuth2 scopes for RBAC implementation
- Implement proper session storage (Redis recommended for production)
- Ensure audit logs contain sufficient information for security analysis
