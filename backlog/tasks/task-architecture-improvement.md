## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Improve the EmailIntelligence platform architecture by addressing key weaknesses identified in the architecture review. Focus on eliminating global state, improving data management, resolving dependency issues, and optimizing performance.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Global state management eliminated from all components
- [ ] #2 File-based storage migrated to proper database system
- [ ] #3 Circular dependencies resolved
- [ ] #4 Legacy code removed from backend directory
- [ ] #5 Search performance optimized to reduce disk I/O
- [ ] #6 Security vulnerabilities addressed
- [ ] #7 Test coverage improved for critical components
- [ ] #8 Deployment process simplified and standardized
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Complete refactoring to remove global state and singleton patterns
2. Plan and implement migration from file-based storage to database
3. Identify and resolve circular dependencies between modules
4. Remove deprecated code from backend directory
5. Optimize search performance and reduce disk I/O operations
6. Implement additional security measures for input validation
7. Improve test coverage for critical components
8. Simplify and standardize deployment process
9. Update documentation to reflect architectural changes
10. Conduct performance testing and benchmarking
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Based on the architecture review, the platform has solid foundations but needs improvements in several key areas. Focus on the high-priority recommendations first, particularly eliminating global state and improving data management. The migration to a proper database system should be planned carefully to ensure data integrity during the transition.
