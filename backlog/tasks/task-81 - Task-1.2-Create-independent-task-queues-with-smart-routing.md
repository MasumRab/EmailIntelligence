## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement task queue system that routes tasks to appropriate agents without dependencies.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Independent task queues created for different documentation types (API, guides, architecture)
- [ ] #2 Smart routing algorithm matches tasks to agent capabilities and current load
- [ ] #3 Queue supports priority levels (critical, high, normal, low)
- [ ] #4 Real-time queue monitoring shows agent utilization >85%
- [ ] #5 No blocking between parallel agent operations
