## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement multiple sync processes for different worktrees simultaneously.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Parallel sync workers handle multiple worktrees concurrently
- [ ] #2 Worker pool scales to number of active worktrees
- [ ] #3 Sync operations don't block each other
- [ ] #4 Resource usage monitored and optimized
- [ ] #5 Parallel sync completes 3x faster than sequential
