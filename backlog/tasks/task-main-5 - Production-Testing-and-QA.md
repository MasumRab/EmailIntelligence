## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement comprehensive testing strategy and QA processes to ensure production-ready code quality, including automated testing, performance validation, and security testing.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Production Testing and QA

Implement comprehensive testing strategy for production releases including load testing, security testing, and integration testing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated regression test suite for production
- [ ] Load testing with realistic user scenarios
- [ ] Security penetration testing completed
- [ ] Integration testing across all components
- [ ] Performance testing under production load
- [ ] Failover and disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Data integrity testing

### Testing Environments
- [ ] Staging environment mirroring production
- [ ] Performance testing environment
- [ ] Security testing environment
- [ ] Automated deployment to test environments

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Code coverage > 90% for critical components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scan passing
- [ ] Manual QA sign-off required
- [ ] Automated smoke tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing

### Continuous Testing
- [ ] Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance regression testing
- [ ] Security scanning in pipeline
- [ ] Automated deployment verification

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Achieve 95%+ code coverage across all modules with comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] #2 Implement and validate integration tests for API endpoints and database operations
- [ ] #3 Set up end-to-end testing for critical user workflows
- [ ] #4 Implement performance testing with load testing and benchmarking
- [ ] #5 Conduct security testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] #6 Document testing procedures and maintain test automation

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Audit current test coverage using coverage.py and identify gaps in backend/, src/, and modules/\n2. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all core modules (auth, database, AI engine, API routes)\n3. Create integration tests for API endpoints, database operations, and external service integrations\n4. Set up end-to-end testing framework with Selenium/Playwright for critical user workflows\n5. Implement performance testing with locust for load testing and stress testing scenarios\n6. Add security testing with automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing\n7. Create test automation CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for continuous testing\n8. Implement test data management and mocking strategies for reliable test environments\n9. Add accessibility testing for web interfaces and API compliance testing\n10. Document testing procedures, create test runbooks, and establish quality gates
