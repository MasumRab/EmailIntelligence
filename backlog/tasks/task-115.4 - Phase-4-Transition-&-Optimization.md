## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Fully transition to the new worktree management system, decommission legacy components, remove all references to the old `git subtree` methodology and `launch-setup-fixes`, and update all relevant documentation.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All active worktrees (e.g., `main`, `worktree-workflow-system`) are successfully operating under the new worktree management system.
- [ ] #2 Legacy `git subtree` methodology for shared setup files is fully deprecated and removed from all active workflows.
- [ ] #3 All references to `launch-setup-fixes` and the old `git subtree` commands are removed from the codebase and documentation.
- [ ] #4 All relevant documentation (guides, references, team documentation) is updated to reflect the new worktree management system.
- [ ] #5 CI/CD pipelines are updated to be fully compatible with the new worktree management system.
- [ ] #6 Team members are trained on the new worktree management workflow and best practices.
