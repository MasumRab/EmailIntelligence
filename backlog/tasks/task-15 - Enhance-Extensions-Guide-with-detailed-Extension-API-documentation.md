## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The 'Extension System' section in README.md and the 'Extensions Guide' (docs/extensions_guide.md) mention an Extension API. However, the documentation for this API is high-level and lacks concrete examples or detailed instructions on how extensions can interact with core application components like the AI Engine, Data Store, User Interface, or Event System. This task involves enhancing the 'Extensions Guide' with comprehensive documentation for the Extension API.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Add detailed explanations and code examples for accessing the AI Engine from an extension.
- [ ] #2 Provide clear instructions and examples for interacting with the Data Store (reading, writing, querying data) from an extension.
- [ ] #3 Document how extensions can add or modify UI components within the application.
- [ ] #4 Explain the Event System, including how extensions can subscribe to and publish events.
- [ ] #5 Ensure the updated documentation includes practical use cases and best practices for each API interaction.
