# Backlog Task: Extract Security Fixes from Large Branches

## Task ID: task-extract-security-fixes-1

## Priority: High

## Status: Not Started

## Description
This task focuses on extracting critical security fixes from the large branches and creating focused PRs for them. Security fixes should be prioritized and handled separately from other changes.

## Target Branches

### 1. fix-critical-issues
- Security fixes to extract:
  - Path traversal protections
  - Input validation improvements
  - Authentication/authorization enhancements
  - Data protection measures

### 2. fix/sqlite-paths
- Security fixes to extract:
  - SQLite database path validation
  - Protection against path traversal attacks
  - Secure database file handling

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Identify all security-related changes in target branches
2. Determine which fixes are still relevant (not already in scientific)
3. Document each security issue being addressed

### Part 2: Extraction
1. Create new branch from current scientific: `security/extracted-fixes`
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement security fixes one by one
3. Ensure each fix is isolated and well-tested

### Part 3: Validation
1. Test each security fix thoroughly
2. Verify no regressions are introduced
3. Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

### Part 4: Documentation
1. Document each security fix with clear explanations
2. Include information about the vulnerability being addressed
3. Provide testing instructions for reviewers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All critical security fixes are extracted
- [ ] Each fix is in its own focused PR
- [ ] All security fixes pass tests
- [ ] No security functionality is lost
- [ ] Clear documentation for each fix

## Dependencies
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Understanding of current security measures in place

## Estimated Effort
1-2 days: Analysis and identification
2-3 days: Extraction and implementation
1 day: Testing and documentation

## Notes
- Security fixes should be reviewed by multiple team members
- Consider running security scanning tools on changes
- Each fix should be minimal and focused
- Coordinate with security team if available
- Always check if security fixes already exist in scientific branch before extracting
- Use incremental approach - extract and test one fix at a time
- Focus only on security-related changes, avoiding unrelated modifications
