# Task: Performance Optimization - Caching Strategy

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Description
Enhance the caching strategy to improve application performance.

## Current Implementation
In-memory caching with write-behind strategy.

## Requirements
1. Add Redis-based distributed caching for multi-instance deployments
2. Implement cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data
3. Add cache invalidation policies
4. Monitor cache hit rates and optimize accordingly
