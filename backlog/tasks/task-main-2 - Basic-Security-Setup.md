## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement basic application-level security measures including authentication, authorization, secure headers, and safe error handling to protect the EmailIntelligence application from common vulnerabilities.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Basic Security Setup

Implement essential security measures for local development and basic production readiness, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data protection without container-specific concerns.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement basic user authentication system
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- [ ] Ensure secure password storage with proper hashing
- [ ] Implement session management with secure tokens
- [ ] Add input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities
- [ ] Set up basic API rate limiting
- [ ] Document security best practices for developers
- [ ] Create security checklist for code reviews

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on application-level security rather than infrastructure/container security
- Use proven libraries and frameworks for authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
- Implement security headers for HTTP responses
- Add proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Ensure database connections use secure credentials
- Document common security pitfalls to avoid
- Test security measures with common attack vectors

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Implement JWT-based authentication for sensitive API endpoints
- [x] #2 Add security headers (CORS, Content-Security-Policy, etc.) to HTTP responses
- [x] #3 Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- [x] #4 Ensure secure handling of database credentials and connections
- [x] #5 Document security best practices and common pitfalls to avoid
- [x] #6 Test security measures against common attack vectors

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review current security implementation in the codebase (authentication, headers, error handling)\n2. Identify gaps and missing security features\n3. Implement JWT-based authentication for sensitive API endpoints\n4. Add security middleware for HTTP headers (CORS, CSP, etc.)\n5. Update error handlers to prevent information disclosure\n6. Ensure secure database credential management\n7. Document security best practices and update README\n8. Test security measures with basic attack vector checks
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented JWT authentication for email API endpoints in modules/email/routes.py. Added CORS and security headers middleware (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, HSTS, CSP) to src/main.py. Enhanced error handlers to return generic messages without exposing sensitive details. Database settings use environment variables for secure configuration. Updated README.md with security best practices and common pitfalls. Manual verification confirms auth endpoints work and security measures are in place.
