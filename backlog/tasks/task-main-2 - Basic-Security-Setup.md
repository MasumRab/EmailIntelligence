## Basic Security Setup

Implement essential security measures for local development and basic production readiness, focusing on authentication, authorization, and data protection without container-specific concerns.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement basic user authentication system
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- [ ] Ensure secure password storage with proper hashing
- [ ] Implement session management with secure tokens
- [ ] Add input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities
- [ ] Set up basic API rate limiting
- [ ] Document security best practices for developers
- [ ] Create security checklist for code reviews

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on application-level security rather than infrastructure/container security
- Use proven libraries and frameworks for authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
- Implement security headers for HTTP responses
- Add proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Ensure database connections use secure credentials
- Document common security pitfalls to avoid
- Test security measures with common attack vectors
