# Task: AI Model Performance Optimization

## Priority
LOW

## Description
Optimize AI model performance for faster inference and better resource utilization.

## Current Implementation
Transformer models with accelerator support.

## Requirements
1. Implement model quantization for faster inference
2. Add model loading optimization (lazy loading, preloading)
3. Implement batch processing for multiple emails
4. Add model performance monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- Model inference is faster with quantization
- Model loading is optimized for better startup times
- Batch processing improves throughput
- Model performance is monitored and reported

## Estimated Effort
16 hours

## Dependencies
