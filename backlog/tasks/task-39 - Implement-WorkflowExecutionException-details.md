The  statement in  indicates that the  class currently has no additional implementation beyond its base  class. This task is to add any necessary custom attributes or methods to enhance exception handling.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Define custom attributes or methods for WorkflowExecutionException
- [ ] #2 Ensure exception provides relevant context for workflow failures
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statement in `WorkflowExecutionException` was introduced when the class was created. It currently defines an empty exception class. This task involves adding any custom attributes or methods to `WorkflowExecutionException` to provide more detailed context or functionality for workflow execution failures.
