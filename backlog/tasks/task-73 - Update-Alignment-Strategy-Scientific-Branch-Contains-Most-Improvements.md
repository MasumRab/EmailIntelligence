## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Update the alignment strategy based on analysis of both branches. The scientific branch already contains most architectural improvements from the backup-branch but with additional enhancements. Instead of cherry-picking from backup-branch, we need to identify what the backup-branch might be missing compared to the scientific branch and plan the proper merge approach.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Document which features are present in scientific but not in backup-branch
- [x] #2 Identify what improvements from backup-branch are already implemented in scientific
- [x] #3 Plan the proper merge direction (likely scientific -> backup-branch)
- [x] #4 Update the alignment tasks accordingly
- [x] #5 Document the recommended approach for final merge
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
This task has been completed successfully. The analysis confirmed that the scientific branch contains significantly more advanced features and architectural improvements than what would typically be found in a backup branch. The recommended approach is to merge from scientific to backup-branch to ensure the backup-branch is up-to-date with all improvements.

Key findings:
1. Scientific branch contains complete dependency injection implementation
2. Full repository pattern with caching layer is implemented
3. Enhanced security features with path validation are present
4. Git subtree integration support is available
5. Comprehensive dashboard statistics with caching are implemented
6. Complete NotmuchDataSource implementation is available

All acceptance criteria have been met with comprehensive documentation of the merge strategy and approach.
