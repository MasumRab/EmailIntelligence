## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Fix Windows-specific issues with launch.bat script including path resolution, conda environment detection, and cross-platform compatibility.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Fix path resolution issues in Windows batch script
- [x] #2 Ensure proper conda environment activation on Windows
- [ ] #3 Test launch.bat on clean Windows environment
- [ ] #4 Verify compatibility with different Windows versions
- [x] #5 Update launch.bat to handle spaces in paths
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze current launch.bat and launch.py for Windows-specific issues\n2. Fix path resolution problems in batch script\n3. Improve conda environment detection and activation on Windows\n4. Add proper error handling and logging\n5. Test on different Windows versions and environments\n6. Handle spaces in paths correctly
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Enhanced launch.bat with comprehensive Windows support: path resolution fixes, conda environment detection, proper error handling, and space-in-path support. Added directory change logic to ensure consistent execution regardless of where the script is called from. Included Python version checking and helpful error messages for common issues. The script now provides clear feedback about conda availability and execution status.
