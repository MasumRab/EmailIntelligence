## Description
This task involves verifying the extracted PRs, addressing any feedback, and merging them into the scientific branch. The focus is on ensuring quality and maintaining codebase stability.

## PRs to Verify and Merge

### 1. Security Fixes PRs
- `security/extracted-fixes` (or similar named branches)
- Priority: High - Review and merge first

### 2. Launch Script Fixes PR

- Priority: Low

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Initial Verification
1. Review each PR's code changes
2. Run tests locally for each PR
3. Check for any conflicts with current scientific branch
4. Verify PR descriptions are clear and complete

### Part 2: Address Feedback
1. Respond to reviewer comments promptly
2. Make requested changes
3. Re-run tests after changes
4. Request re-review when changes are complete

### Part 3: Final Testing
1. Ensure all tests pass for each PR
2. Test integration with other recent changes
3. Verify no regressions are introduced
4. Check performance impact (if applicable)

### Part 4: Merge Process
1. Merge PRs in priority order (security first)
2. Update scientific branch after each merge
3. Verify scientific branch stability after each merge
4. Update other pending PRs if conflicts arise
