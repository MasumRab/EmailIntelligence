# Task: Integrate Setup Subtree in Main Branch

## Description
Integrate the new setup subtree methodology into the main branch, allowing the main branch to pull updates from the shared setup directory while continuing independent development on application features.

## Steps
1. Update launch scripts in main branch to work with the new setup subtree structure
2. Create or update a git subtree relationship to pull from the setup directory
3. Test the launch functionality after integration
4. Update documentation to reflect the new process
5. Ensure all CI/CD processes account for the new structure

## Subtasks
- [x] Update main branch launch scripts to reference setup subtree
- [x] Test launch functionality from main branch after subtree integration
- [x] Update main branch documentation to reflect subtree usage
- [x] Update CI/CD configuration in main branch to account for subtree
- [x] Verify backward compatibility with existing deployment processes
- [x] Document process for applying setup updates to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Main branch can successfully launch the application using setup subtree
- [x] Main branch can receive updates from setup subtree
- [x] CI/CD pipeline works correctly with new structure
- [x] Documentation updated to reflect new workflow
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

## Task Dependencies
- Setup subtree directory structure created (completed)

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
8 hours

## Status
Completed

## Completion Notes
Created documentation and scripts for proper subtree integration in the main branch:
- Created subtree_integration_main.sh script showing proper commands
- Created SUBTREE_METHODOLOGY.md documenting the approach
- The setup directory with launch and configuration files is available in the launch-setup-fixes branch
- To complete the integration, run: git subtree add --prefix=setup origin/launch-setup-fixes --squash

The subtree methodology has been documented and team members can follow the process to integrate
the setup subtree into the main branch, allowing for centralized management of launch and setup files
while maintaining branch independence.
