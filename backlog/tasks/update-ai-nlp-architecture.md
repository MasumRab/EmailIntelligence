# Task: Update AI/NLP Architecture in Scientific Branch

## Task ID: task-update-ai-nlp-architecture

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Todo

## Description
Update the AI/NLP architecture in the scientific branch to align with the more recent model management and analysis capabilities in the main branch. This includes dynamic model management, analysis components, and fallback strategies.

## Target Branch
- Branch: `scientific`
- Based on: Current scientific branch state
- Integration target: Main branch AI/NLP architecture

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Implement updated model management system
2. Update analysis components to match main branch
3. Align fallback strategies for AI components
4. Ensure consistent model loading/unloading patterns

## Action Plan

### Part 1: AI/NLP Analysis
1. Compare AI/NLP implementations between branches
2. Identify differences in model management
3. Document improvements in main branch AI system
4. Assess current AI/NLP capabilities in scientific branch

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Update model management to use main branch approach
2. Align analysis components with main branch
3. Implement consistent fallback strategies
4. Ensure model loading/unloading patterns match

### Part 3: Testing
1. Run AI/NLP-specific tests for all components
2. Verify model loading and unloading works correctly
3. Test analysis components for accuracy
4. Validate fallback mechanisms work as expected

### Part 4: Validation
1. Compare AI analysis results with main branch
2. Run full test suite to catch any regressions
3. Validate performance of AI components
4. Document changes for AI model maintainers

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Model management system aligned with main branch
- [ ] Analysis components updated and functional
- [ ] Fallback strategies properly implemented
- [ ] AI/NLP tests pass
- [ ] Performance of AI components is acceptable
- [ ] Results consistency with main branch verified
- [ ] PR created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- Security architecture update completed
- Model management documentation from main branch available

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days: Analysis and implementation
1 day: AI/NLP testing
0.5 days: Validation and documentation
0.5 days: PR creation

## Notes
- AI/NLP components can be complex, careful testing is needed
- Ensure model compatibility between branches
- Validate AI results accuracy after updates
- Consider impact on model training workflows
