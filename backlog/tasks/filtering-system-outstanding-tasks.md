# Outstanding Tasks for Enhanced Email Filtering System

## Task 1: Add Comprehensive Testing for Enhanced Filtering System

### Title
Add Comprehensive Testing for Enhanced Filtering System

### Description
Implement comprehensive tests for the enhanced filtering system that was added to the FilterNode class. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests to ensure the new filtering capabilities work correctly and efficiently.

### Labels
testing, filtering, backend, enhancement

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create unit tests for all new filtering criteria in FilterNode (`_matches_criteria` method)
- [ ] Create integration tests that test the FilterNode with various email data
- [ ] Implement performance tests to ensure filtering efficiency with large email volumes
- [ ] Add tests for the new boolean logic implementation
- [ ] Test edge cases such as empty criteria, null values, and malformed data

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All new filtering criteria have unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass with various email data sets
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show acceptable filtering speeds
- [ ] Error handling is properly tested

## Task 2: Enhance Advanced Filtering UI Experience

### Title
Enhance Advanced Filtering UI Experience

### Description
Improve the user experience of the AdvancedFilterPanel component to make it easier for users to create and manage complex filtering rules. Add additional UI components and validation to improve usability.

### Labels
ui, filtering, frontend, enhancement

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add nested boolean operations (grouping conditions)
- [ ] Implement filter validation and error messaging
- [ ] Add filter templates for common use cases
- [ ] Improve the layout for complex filter conditions
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality for filter building

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can create nested boolean conditions
- [ ] Clear error messages are displayed for invalid conditions
- [ ] Common filter templates are available
- [ ] UI remains responsive with many filter conditions
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality works as expected

## Task 3: Optimize Filtering Performance

### Title
Optimize Filtering Performance

### Description
Profile and optimize the performance of the filtering system, especially when processing large volumes of emails. Implement caching and algorithmic improvements where appropriate.

### Labels
performance, filtering, backend, optimization

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Profile the current filtering implementation with large email sets
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently used filters
- [ ] Optimize the filtering algorithm to reduce unnecessary string operations
- [ ] Add pagination for filter results if needed
- [ ] Consider parallel processing for independent filters

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filtering performance benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] Caching implementation reduces repeated operations
- [ ] Filtering system maintains good performance with 1000+ emails
- [ ] Memory usage is optimized

## Task 4: Implement Filter Import/Export Functionality

### Title
Implement Filter Import/Export Functionality

### Description
Add functionality to save, share, and load filter configurations. This will allow users to store and reuse complex filter rules across sessions or share them with other users.

### Labels
features, filtering, backend, frontend

### Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add API endpoints to save/load filter configurations
- [ ] Implement export functionality in the UI
- [ ] Implement import functionality in the UI
- [ ] Add filter versioning to handle schema changes
- [ ] Add filter import validation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can export filter configurations to a file
- [ ] Users can import filter configurations from a file
- [ ] Filter configurations are properly validated on import
- [ ] Version control prevents import of incompatible filters
- [ ] API endpoints work correctly for filter persistence
