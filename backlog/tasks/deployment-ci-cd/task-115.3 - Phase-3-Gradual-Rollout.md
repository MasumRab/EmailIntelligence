## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Worktrees created and initialized - main and scientific worktrees set up with proper directory structures
- [ ] #2 Current documentation state copied - existing docs and configurations migrated to worktree structure
- [ ] #3 Parallel operation established - both legacy and worktree systems running simultaneously
- [ ] #4 Basic worktree operations validated - creation, management, and basic synchronization working
- [ ] #5 Incremental features migrated - consolidation decisions, conflict resolution, and health monitoring operational
