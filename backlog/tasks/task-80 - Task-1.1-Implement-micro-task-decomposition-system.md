## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Break large documentation tasks into micro-tasks completable in <15 minutes for better parallel utilization.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Task decomposition algorithm implemented that splits documentation tasks by section/type
- [ ] #2 Micro-tasks defined with clear inputs, outputs, and time estimates (<15min)
- [ ] #3 Task queue supports micro-task dependencies and parallel execution paths
- [ ] #4 Agent capability matching ensures appropriate task assignment
- [ ] #5 Performance metrics show 45% faster completion rates
