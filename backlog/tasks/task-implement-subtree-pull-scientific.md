# Task: Implement Git Subtree Pull Process for Scientific Branch

## Description
Implement the actual git subtree pull process to allow the scientific branch to integrate and update the setup subtree as needed.

## Steps
1. Set up the subtree relationship between the scientific branch and the setup directory
2. Test the subtree pull functionality
3. Document the process for the development team
4. Create scripts if needed to simplify the subtree operations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Configure subtree relationship in scientific branch
- [ ] Test pulling updates from setup subtree to scientific branch
- [ ] Create helper script for subtree operations in scientific branch
- [ ] Document the subtree pull process for scientific branch
- [ ] Test the complete workflow with a sample update

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Subtree pull operations work correctly from setup to scientific
- [ ] Helper script functions properly (if created)
- [ ] Process is documented clearly for team members
- [ ] Sample update successfully applied to scientific branch

## Task Dependencies

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
6 hours

## Status
Pending

## Additional Notes
This task focuses on the technical implementation of git subtree functionality specifically for the scientific branch. The scientific branch may have different requirements and dependencies, so it should be tested carefully to ensure compatibility with the common setup infrastructure.
