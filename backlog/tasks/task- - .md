## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Optimize database performance for better scalability and response times.

## Current Implementation
JSON file storage with indexing.

## Requirements
1. Add query optimization for complex searches
2. Implement pagination optimization
3. Add database connection pooling
4. Consider database sharding for large datasets
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

# Task: Database Performance Optimization

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Acceptance Criteria
- Complex queries execute efficiently
- Pagination works well with large datasets
- Database connections are properly pooled
- System scales well with large datasets

## Estimated Effort
20 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Related Files
- src/core/database.py
- src/core/data_source.py
- Performance monitoring modules

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Analyze current query patterns and optimize indexes
- Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance
- Add connection pooling for concurrent access
- Consider migration path to proper database system

Initial investigation suggests this task was not implemented. No related commits were found, and a review of the database-related code reveals none of the specified optimizations (query optimization, advanced pagination, connection pooling) have been added. The current implementation remains a basic JSON file-based database.
