# Backlog Task: Create PR for Data Source Abstraction Refactor

## Task ID: task-create-refactor-pr-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that implements the data source abstraction improvements from the `refactor-data-source-abstraction` branch. This PR should improve code organization and maintainability without breaking existing functionality.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `refactor-data-source-abstraction`
- Create new branch: `refactor/data-source-improvements`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Data source abstraction improvements
2. Repository pattern enhancements
3. Factory pattern implementation for data sources
4. Improved dependency injection for data access

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `refactor-data-source-abstraction` branch for key improvements
2. Check if these improvements already exist in scientific branch
3. Identify the core refactorings that provide the most value
4. Document the benefits of the abstraction improvements

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `refactor/data-source-improvements` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the core refactorings
3. Ensure changes maintain backward compatibility
4. Update existing code to use the new abstraction where appropriate

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the refactorings
2. Document benefits of the new abstraction
3. Include migration guide for existing code
4. Add architectural diagrams if helpful

### Part 4: Testing
1. Run all existing tests to ensure no regressions
2. Add tests for new abstraction patterns
3. Verify performance is not negatively impacted
4. Test integration with existing components

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Data source abstraction improvements are implemented
- [ ] PR addresses only refactoring changes
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New abstraction is well-tested
- [ ] PR description is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] GitHub PR is created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- Current PRs (docs cleanup, search in category) should be merged first
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Security fixes PR should be prioritized first

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days: Analysis and identification
3-4 days: Implementation and testing
1 day: Documentation and PR creation

## Notes
- Focus only on core refactorings, avoid unrelated changes
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Ensure clear separation of concerns in the new abstraction
- Document any breaking changes and migration paths
- Coordinate with team members who work with data access code
- Run performance tests to ensure no degradation
