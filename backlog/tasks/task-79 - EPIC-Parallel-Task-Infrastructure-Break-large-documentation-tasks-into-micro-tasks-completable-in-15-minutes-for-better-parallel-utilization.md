## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Migration of documentation system to concurrent multi-agent optimized worktree setup. This enables parallel agent workflows for documentation generation, review, and maintenance with automatic inheritance and quality assurance.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Task decomposition algorithm implemented that splits documentation tasks by section/type
- [ ] #2 Micro-tasks defined with clear inputs, outputs, and time estimates (<15min)
- [ ] #3 Task queue supports micro-task dependencies and parallel execution paths
- [ ] #4 Agent capability matching ensures appropriate task assignment
- [ ] #5 Performance metrics show 45% faster completion rates
