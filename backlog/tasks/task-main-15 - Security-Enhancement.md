## Security Enhancement

Strengthen the security posture of the Email Intelligence Platform with enhanced encryption, authentication, and access controls to protect user data and maintain compliance with privacy regulations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption for email data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Enhance user authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- [ ] Add audit logging for all data access and modifications
- [ ] Implement secure API key management and rotation
- [ ] Add data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities
- [ ] Enhance password policies and implement secure password storage
- [ ] Conduct security vulnerability assessment and penetration testing

### Implementation Notes
- Review current security implementation in `src/core/security.py`
- Consider implementing OAuth 2.0 for enhanced authentication
- Evaluate industry-standard encryption libraries for email data protection
- Implement secure session management with proper timeout mechanisms
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Ensure GDPR and other privacy regulation compliance
- Implement secure communication protocols (TLS 1.3)
- Add security headers to all HTTP responses
- Consider implementing zero-trust architecture principles
- Document security procedures and best practices
