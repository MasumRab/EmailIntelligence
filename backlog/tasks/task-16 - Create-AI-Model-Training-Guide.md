## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The README.md suggests creating a dedicated guide in `docs/ai_model_training_guide.md` for more detailed instructions on data preparation and model training workflows. This task involves creating this new documentation file.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Create a new markdown file at `docs/ai_model_training_guide.md`.
- [x] #2 Outline the key sections of the guide, including data acquisition, data labeling, model configuration, training process, and model saving.
- [x] #3 Provide guidance on preparing labeled datasets for different AI model types (e.g., topic, sentiment, intent, urgency).
- [x] #4 Include examples of how to modify `backend/python_nlp/ai_training.py` or create wrapper scripts to load custom datasets and train models.
- [x] #5 Detail the expected filenames and locations for saving trained models so they can be loaded by `backend/python_nlp/nlp_engine.py`.
- [x] #6 Add best practices for model evaluation and iteration.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Examine existing AI training code and model structure\n2. Create comprehensive guide covering data preparation, training, and deployment\n3. Include practical examples and code snippets\n4. Document model file locations and naming conventions\n5. Add evaluation and iteration best practices\n6. Test the guide with example implementations
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive AI Model Training Guide at docs/ai_model_training_guide.md covering data acquisition, preprocessing, model configuration, training process, evaluation metrics, deployment procedures, and best practices. Included practical code examples for all model types (sentiment, topic, intent, urgency) with both traditional ML and transformer-based approaches. Documented expected file locations and naming conventions matching the existing codebase structure.
