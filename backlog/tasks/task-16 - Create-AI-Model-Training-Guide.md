## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The README.md suggests creating a dedicated guide in `docs/ai_model_training_guide.md` for more detailed instructions on data preparation and model training workflows. This task involves creating this new documentation file.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Create a new markdown file at `docs/ai_model_training_guide.md`.
- [ ] #2 Outline the key sections of the guide, including data acquisition, data labeling, model configuration, training process, and model saving.
- [ ] #3 Provide guidance on preparing labeled datasets for different AI model types (e.g., topic, sentiment, intent, urgency).
- [ ] #4 Include examples of how to modify `backend/python_nlp/ai_training.py` or create wrapper scripts to load custom datasets and train models.
- [ ] #5 Detail the expected filenames and locations for saving trained models so they can be loaded by `backend/python_nlp/nlp_engine.py`.
- [ ] #6 Add best practices for model evaluation and iteration.
