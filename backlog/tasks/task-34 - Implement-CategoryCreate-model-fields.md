## Description

The  statement in  indicates that the  model currently has no additional fields beyond its base model. This task is to define any necessary fields for creating a new category.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Define relevant fields for CategoryCreate model
- [ ] #2 Ensure fields are validated correctly
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The `pass` statement in `CategoryCreate` was introduced when the class was created. It currently inherits all fields from `CategoryBase`. This task involves adding any new fields or specific validation required for creating a category, beyond what is provided by the base model.
