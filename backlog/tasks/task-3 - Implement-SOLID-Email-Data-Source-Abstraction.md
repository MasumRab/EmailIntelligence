## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement SOLID principles for email data source abstraction to improve code maintainability, testability, and extensibility of data access patterns.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Design abstraction layer
- [x] #2 Implement interface segregation
- [x] #3 Add dependency inversion
- [x] #4 Refactor existing code to use abstraction

- [x] #5 Design clean abstraction layer following SOLID principles
- [x] #6 Implement interface segregation for different data operations
- [x] #7 Add dependency inversion to decouple high-level modules
- [x] #8 Refactor existing email data access code to use new abstraction
- [x] #9 Add comprehensive unit tests for abstraction layer
- [x] #10 Document the new architecture and usage patterns
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented SOLID principles for email data source abstraction across the codebase:

**Single Responsibility Principle:**
- Separated data access concerns from business logic
- Each repository class has single responsibility for data operations

**Open/Closed Principle:**
- Abstract base classes allow extension without modification
- New data sources can be added by implementing interfaces

**Liskov Substitution Principle:**
- All repository implementations are interchangeable
- Interface contracts are consistently implemented

**Interface Segregation Principle:**
- Separate interfaces for different data operations
- Clients depend only on methods they use

**Dependency Inversion Principle:**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- Factory pattern for dependency injection

**Key Components:**
- `DataSource` abstract base class in `src/core/data_source.py`
- `DatabaseDataSource` and `NotmuchDataSource` implementations
- `Repository` pattern with `EmailRepository` interface
- Factory classes for creating appropriate instances

**Refactoring:**
- Updated existing code to use abstraction layer
- Maintained backward compatibility during transition
- Improved testability and maintainability

**Benefits:**
- Easier testing with mock implementations
- Flexible data source switching
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced code maintainability
