## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All backend source code is successfully moved from the 'backend' directory to 'src/backend'.
- [ ] #2 All internal imports and external references throughout the codebase are updated to reflect the new 'src/backend' path.
- [ ] #3 All relevant configuration files (e.g., Docker, tsconfig, build scripts) are updated to support the new backend structure.
- [ ] #4 The full test suite passes without errors after the migration.
- [ ] #5 The original 'backend' directory is completely removed from the project.
- [ ] #6 All migration sub-tasks are marked as 'Done'.
