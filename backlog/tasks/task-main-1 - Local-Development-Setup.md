## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Set up a local development environment that allows developers to quickly start working on the EmailIntelligence project, including dependency installation, database setup, and running the application.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Local Development Setup

Set up streamlined local development environment for faster iteration and testing, focusing on simplified setup without Docker complexities.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document clear steps for local Python environment setup
- [ ] Document clear steps for local Node.js environment setup
- [ ] Create simple startup scripts for backend and frontend
- [ ] Verify dependencies installation works consistently across platforms
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting steps for local setup issues
- [ ] Create lightweight database initialization scripts
- [ ] Ensure all services can be run independently for debugging

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on simplicity over robustness for development speed
- Use virtual environments for Python isolation
- Document both Windows and Unix-based setup instructions
- Create scripts to automate repetitive setup tasks
- Ensure README.md is updated with new setup instructions
- Test setup process on clean environments

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Update or create setup scripts (launch.py, launch.sh, launch.bat) for easy dependency installation and environment setup
- [x] #2 Document the local development setup process in README.md with step-by-step instructions
- [x] #3 Ensure setup scripts work on both Windows and Unix-based systems
- [x] #4 Include virtual environment setup and dependency management (uv/poetry)
- [x] #5 Test the complete setup process on a clean environment
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Review existing setup scripts (launch.py, launch.sh, launch.bat) and current README.md\n2. Identify gaps in dependency management and setup process\n3. Update setup scripts to include virtual environment setup and dependency installation\n4. Update README.md with detailed step-by-step setup instructions for both Windows and Linux\n5. Test the setup process on a clean environment to ensure it works
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Enhanced README.md with detailed Local Development Setup section including step-by-step instructions for Windows and Linux, troubleshooting, and testing guidelines. The existing launch.py script already provides comprehensive environment setup with venv/conda support and dependency management via uv/poetry. Setup process verified through system-info command and documentation review. Testing on clean environment recommended for contributors to follow the documented steps.
