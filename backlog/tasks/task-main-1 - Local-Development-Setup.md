## Local Development Setup

Set up streamlined local development environment for faster iteration and testing, focusing on simplified setup without Docker complexities.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document clear steps for local Python environment setup
- [ ] Document clear steps for local Node.js environment setup
- [ ] Create simple startup scripts for backend and frontend
- [ ] Verify dependencies installation works consistently across platforms
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting steps for local setup issues
- [ ] Create lightweight database initialization scripts
- [ ] Ensure all services can be run independently for debugging

### Implementation Notes
- Focus on simplicity over robustness for development speed
- Use virtual environments for Python isolation
- Document both Windows and Unix-based setup instructions
- Create scripts to automate repetitive setup tasks
- Ensure README.md is updated with new setup instructions
- Test setup process on clean environments
