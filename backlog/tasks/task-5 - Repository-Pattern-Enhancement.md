# Task: Repository Pattern Enhancement

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Description
Enhance the repository pattern implementation with additional features.

## Current Implementation
Basic repository pattern with DataSource abstraction.

## Requirements
1. Add caching layer to repository implementation
2. Implement transaction support for data operations
3. Add bulk operation support for better performance
4. Consider adding query builder for complex searches

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repository implementations support caching
- Transaction support is available for data operations
- Bulk operations are implemented and performant
- Query builder simplifies complex searches

## Estimated Effort
20 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Implementation Notes
- Implement caching at the repository level to avoid duplicate data source calls
- Add transaction context managers for atomic operations
- Implement bulk operations for common use cases like bulk email creation
- Consider using a query builder library or implementing a simple one
