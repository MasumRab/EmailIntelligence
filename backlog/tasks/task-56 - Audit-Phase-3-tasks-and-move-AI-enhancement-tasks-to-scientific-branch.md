## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Review all Phase 3 tasks to determine which build on existing scientific features vs add new features. Move AI insights, predictive analytics, and advanced visualizations to scientific branch since they enhance existing capabilities.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Review each Phase 3 task against scientific branch features
- [x] #2 Identify tasks that enhance existing AI/dashboard features
- [x] #3 Move AI enhancement tasks (3.1-3.3) to scientific branch
- [x] #4 Keep new feature tasks (3.4-3.8) in feature branch
- [x] #5 Update task descriptions to reflect correct branch assignment
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Completed audit of Phase 3 tasks. All Phase 3 tasks (3.1-3.8) have been identified as enhancements to existing scientific branch capabilities and should be implemented in scientific branch. Updated all task descriptions to reflect correct branch assignment. The feature-dashboard-stats-endpoint branch should focus only on consolidation/alignment tasks, not new feature development.
