## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
The README.md's 'Security Considerations' section notes that the 'Current state might have basic or no auth for some dev routes'. This task involves implementing robust API authentication for all sensitive operations to ensure proper security.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Identify all sensitive API endpoints in the backend that require authentication.
- [x] #2 Implement an authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) for these endpoints.
- [x] #3 Integrate the authentication mechanism with existing user management or create a new one if necessary.
- [x] #4 Ensure all sensitive operations are protected by the implemented authentication.
- [x] #5 Update relevant documentation (e.g., API docs, security guide) to reflect the new authentication requirements and usage.
- [x] #6 Add unit and integration tests for the authentication mechanism.
