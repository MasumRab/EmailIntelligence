# Task: Application Monitoring and Observability

## Priority
MEDIUM

## Description
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability features.

## Current Gaps
- Limited performance monitoring
- No centralized logging
- No error tracking system
- No uptime monitoring

## Requirements
1. Implement application performance monitoring (APM)
2. Add centralized logging with log aggregation
3. Set up error tracking and alerting
4. Implement health check endpoints
5. Add metrics collection and visualization

## Acceptance Criteria
- Performance metrics are collected and viewable
- Logs are centralized and searchable
- Errors are tracked and trigger alerts
- Health check endpoints are available
- Metrics are visualized in dashboards

## Estimated Effort
24 hours

## Dependencies
None
