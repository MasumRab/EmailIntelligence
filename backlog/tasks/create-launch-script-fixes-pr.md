# Backlog Task: Create PR for Launch Script Fixes

## Task ID: task-create-launch-script-pr-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that extracts launch script fixes from the `fix/launch-bat-issues` branch. This PR should address specific launcher issues without including unrelated changes.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `fix/launch-bat-issues`
- Create new branch: `fix/launch-script-improvements`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Windows batch script (.bat) improvements
2. Shell script (.sh) enhancements
3. Cross-platform compatibility fixes
4. Error handling improvements in launch scripts

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `fix/launch-bat-issues` branch for launch script commits
2. Check if these fixes already exist in scientific branch
3. Identify the specific launcher issues being addressed
4. Document the problems with current launch scripts

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `fix/launch-script-improvements` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the launch script fixes
3. Ensure changes work on all supported platforms
4. Add comprehensive tests for the script improvements

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the launcher issues
2. Document how the fixes address each issue
3. Include testing instructions for different platforms
4. Add usage examples if new functionality is added

### Part 4: Testing
1. Test launch scripts on Windows, Linux, and macOS
2. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Ensure performance is not negatively impacted
