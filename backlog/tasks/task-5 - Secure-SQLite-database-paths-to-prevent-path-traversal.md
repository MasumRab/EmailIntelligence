## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive path security measures to prevent directory traversal attacks in SQLite database operations:

**Security Module Created (`src/core/security.py`):**
- `validate_path_safety()`: Detects directory traversal patterns (..), dangerous characters (<>|?*), and validates paths against base directories
- `sanitize_path()`: Resolves and sanitizes paths, ensuring they are safe and optionally within allowed base directories
- `secure_path_join()`: Safely joins path components, preventing traversal through individual components

**Database Security Enhancements:**
- Updated `DatabaseConfig` class to validate all file paths during initialization
- Added path safety checks for data directory, email files, category files, user files, and content directories
- Prevents unsafe environment variable `DATA_DIR` values from compromising security

**Data Migration Security:**
- Enhanced `deployment/data_migration.py` to validate command-line path arguments
- Added security validation for `--data-dir` and `--db-path` parameters
- Prevents path traversal attacks through migration script arguments

**Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/core/test_security.py`):**
- Path validation tests for safe and unsafe paths
- Directory traversal detection tests
- Database configuration security validation
- Data migration script security testing

**Security Documentation:**
- All security functions are documented with clear usage examples
- Test cases cover common attack vectors and edge cases
- Implementation follows principle of fail-safe defaults (reject unsafe paths)

The implementation provides defense-in-depth against path traversal attacks while maintaining usability for legitimate operations.
