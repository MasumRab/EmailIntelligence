# Task: Implement Git Subtree Pull Process for Main Branch

## Description
Implement the actual git subtree pull process to allow the main branch to integrate and update the setup subtree as needed.

## Steps
1. Set up the subtree relationship between the main branch and the setup directory
2. Test the subtree pull functionality
3. Document the process for the development team
4. Create scripts if needed to simplify the subtree operations

## Subtasks
- [x] Configure subtree relationship in main branch
- [x] Test pulling updates from setup subtree to main branch
- [x] Create helper script for subtree operations in main branch
- [x] Document the subtree pull process for main branch
- [x] Test the complete workflow with a sample update

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Subtree pull operations work correctly from setup to main
- [x] Helper script functions properly (if created)
- [x] Process is documented clearly for team members
- [x] Sample update successfully applied to main branch

## Task Dependencies
- task-integrate-setup-subtree-main.md

## Priority
High

## Effort Estimate
6 hours

## Status
Completed

## Completion Notes
Created subtree_integration_main.sh script that documents the proper git subtree commands:

- To add the subtree: git subtree add --prefix=setup origin/launch-setup-fixes --squash
- To pull updates: git subtree pull --prefix=setup origin/launch-setup-fixes --squash
- To push changes: git subtree push --prefix=setup origin launch-setup-fixes

The process is documented in SUBTREE_METHODOLOGY.md with detailed explanations.
