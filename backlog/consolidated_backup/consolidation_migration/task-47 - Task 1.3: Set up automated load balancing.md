title: 'Task 1.3: Set up automated load balancing'
---

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement automatic task distribution based on agent capabilities and performance history.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Agent capability registry tracks skills (markdown, API docs, diagrams, etc.)
- [ ] #2 Load balancing algorithm distributes tasks evenly across available agents
- [ ] #3 Performance history influences task assignment (faster agents get more tasks)
- [ ] #4 Dynamic scaling supports 5+ concurrent agents
- [ ] #5 Load balancing reduces agent idle time by 60%
