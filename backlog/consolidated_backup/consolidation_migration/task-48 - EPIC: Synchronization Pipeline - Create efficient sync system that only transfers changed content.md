title: 'EPIC: Synchronization Pipeline - Create efficient sync system that only transfers
  changed content'
---

## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement incremental sync with change detection for worktrees.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Change detection algorithm identifies modified files only
- [ ] #2 Incremental sync reduces transfer time by 90% for large docs
- [ ] #3 Sync supports partial updates without full worktree refresh
- [ ] #4 Bandwidth usage optimized for remote agent scenarios
- [ ] #5 Incremental sync maintains data consistency across worktrees
