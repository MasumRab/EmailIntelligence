## Session Expectations

### Documentation Standards
- All development activities must be documented in session logs
- Code changes should follow existing project conventions from IFLOW.md
- Tasks should be tracked using the iFlow CLI todo system
- Regular updates should be made to session logs during development

### Quality Assurance
- Follow security best practices as outlined in IFLOW.md
- Maintain code quality through proper testing and verification
- Ensure all changes are properly documented
- Adhere to project coding standards

### Workflow Process
1. **Understand**: Analyze the development task and relevant codebase context
2. **Plan**: Build a coherent plan for implementation
3. **Implement**: Use available tools to act on the plan
4. **Verify**: Run project-specific testing and quality checks
5. **Document**: Update session logs with progress and outcomes

### Collaboration Standards
- Maintain clear communication through session logs
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference
- Ensure work is reproducible by other team members
- Follow established project workflows

## Development Priorities
1. Complete documentation integration
2. Ensure all session activities are properly recorded
3. Maintain alignment with IFLOW.md guidelines
4. Facilitate productive development workflows

## Session Outcomes
1. Successfully established session goals and captured initial context
2. Set clear expectations for documented development sessions
3. Created proper session tracking files following established conventions
4. Verified integration with project documentation ecosystem
5. Provided comprehensive session structure and workflow facilitation

## Session Summary
This session successfully established a framework for documented development sessions with IFLOW.md integration. The session followed the established workflow process:

1. **Understand**: Analyzed the current project state and documentation needs
2. **Plan**: Built a coherent plan for session documentation and tracking
3. **Implement**: Created session logs and updated documentation
4. **Verify**: Confirmed integration with existing project documentation
