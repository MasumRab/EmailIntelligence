# Development Sessions

This directory contains documented development sessions tracked by iFlow CLI. Each session file follows the naming convention `IFLOW-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md` and documents the goals, activities, and outcomes of development work.

## Session Files
- `IFLOW-20251102-001.md` - Current session: Documented development sessions with IFLOW.md integration
- `IFLOW-20251031-001.md` - Previous session: Documented development sessions with IFLOW.md integration
- `IFLOW-20251028-005.md` - Previous session: Documented development sessions with IFLOW.md integration

## Purpose
These session files serve to:
1. Track development progress and context
2. Maintain a historical record of development activities
3. Facilitate knowledge transfer and team collaboration
4. Ensure all development work is properly documented

## Guidelines
- Each session should have a clear goal and outcome
- Activities should be documented as they happen
- Next steps should be clearly identified
- Files should follow the standard session template
