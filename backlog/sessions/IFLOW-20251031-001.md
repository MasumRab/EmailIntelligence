## Session Information
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Session ID**: IFLOW-20251031-001
- **iFlow CLI Version**: 1.0
- **Branch**: scientific

## Session Goals
1. Begin documented development sessions with IFLOW.md integration
2. Establish session goals and capture initial context
3. Set expectations for development workflows
4. Create session tracking files
5. Integrate with project documentation
6. Ensure all session activities are properly recorded

## Initial Context
- Repository is behind origin by 1 commit (documentation workflow guide)
- Working on the scientific branch
- Recent work includes documentation workflow establishment
- One untracked file: branch_management_recommendations.md

## Project Overview
EmailIntelligence is a full-stack application designed to provide intelligent email analysis and management capabilities. The project combines a Python FastAPI backend for AI/NLP tasks with a React frontend and a Gradio-based UI for scientific exploration.

## Key Technologies in Use
- Python 3.12+, FastAPI
- React (Vite), TypeScript
- Custom NLP engine with sentiment, topic, intent, and urgency analysis
- SQLite database
- Node-based workflow system

## Development Conventions
- Following project-specific code organization
- Using dependency injection over global state
- Adhering to security best practices
- Maintaining existing architectural patterns

## Session Activities
1. ✅ Created session tracking file: `IFLOW-20251031-001.md`
2. ✅ Integrated with IFLOW.md documentation
3. ✅ Established session goals and context
4. ✅ Analyzed current repository state and recent changes
5. ✅ Synced repository with origin using `git pull`
6. ✅ Reviewed branch analysis report and current branch status
7. ✅ Staged and committed session tracking files
8. ✅ Reviewed branch management recommendations file
9. ✅ Staged and committed branch management recommendations
10. ✅ Pushed all changes to remote repository

## Next Steps
1. Continue with development workflows as defined in IFLOW.md
2. Maintain proper session documentation throughout development
3. Follow iFlow CLI software engineering workflow:
   - Understand: Analyze requests and codebase context
   - Plan: Build coherent plans based on understanding
   - Implement: Use available tools to act on plans
   - Verify: Run tests and check code standards

## Notes
- All activities are being properly recorded as requested
- Session follows the structure and guidelines defined in IFLOW.md
- Repository is now up to date with origin and all changes have been pushed
