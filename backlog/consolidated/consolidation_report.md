## Consolidation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review high-duplication branches** for consolidation opportunities
2. **Merge similar tasks** across branches where appropriate
3. **Update task references** to point to consolidated versions
4. **Archive redundant branches** after consolidation

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Implement centralized task management** to prevent future duplication
2. **Establish branch-specific task guidelines**
3. **Regular consolidation reviews** to maintain organization
4. **Cross-branch task visibility** for development teams

## Category Utilization

- **Consolidation & Migration**: 11 tasks (91.7%)
- **Development & Implementation**: 1 tasks (8.3%)

## Next Steps

1. Review consolidated categories for completeness
2. Update development workflows to use consolidated tasks
3. Implement automated consolidation checks
4. Monitor for new duplication patterns
