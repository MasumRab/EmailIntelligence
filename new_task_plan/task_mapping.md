# Task Numbering Mapping: Old IDs → New Clean IDs

## Task 75 (Branch Clustering System) Integration into Task 002

**Status:** Task 75 now renumbered as **Task 002** (Clustering System) via WS2 refactoring (Jan 4, 2026)

**Important:** Task 002 is a **separate, independent initiative** (Initiative 3) that runs **parallel** with the main framework tasks (Initiative 1-2). It is NOT the same as Task 002 (Merge Validation Framework from Initiative 1).

| Old ID | New Format | Title | Stage | Effort | Status |
|--------|------------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| Task 75 | 002-Clustering | Branch Clustering System | All | 212-288h | Parallel (separate numbering) |
| 75.1 | 002.1 | CommitHistoryAnalyzer | One | 24-32h | ✅ |
| 75.2 | 002.2 | CodebaseStructureAnalyzer | One | 28-36h | ✅ |
| 75.3 | 002.3 | DiffDistanceCalculator | One | 32-40h | ✅ |
| 75.4 | 002.4 | BranchClusterer | One(I) | 28-36h | ✅ |
| 75.5 | 002.5 | IntegrationTargetAssigner | Two | 24-32h | ✅ |
| 75.6 | 002.6 | PipelineIntegration | Two | 20-28h | ✅ (includes Task 007 merge) |
| 75.7 | 002.7 | VisualizationReporting | Three | 20-28h | ✅ |
| 75.8 | 002.8 | TestingSuite | Three | 24-32h | ✅ |
| 75.9 | 002.9 | FrameworkIntegration | All | 16-24h | ✅ |

**Historical Note:** Task 75 was previously part of scattered codebase analysis. Now unified as dedicated Initiative 3 system.

**Refactoring Context (Jan 4, 2026 - WS2):** 
- Task 021→002 renumbering applied across all documentation
- Task 007 (I2.T4 - Feature Branch Identification) merges into Task 002.6 (PipelineIntegration) as execution mode
