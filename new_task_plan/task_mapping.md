# Task Numbering Mapping: Old IDs → New Clean IDs

## Task 75 (Branch Clustering System) Integration

**Status:** Unified Integration into Initiative 3, Task 002

| Old ID | New Format | Title | Stage | Effort |
|--------|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| Task 75 | I3.T0 (021) | Branch Clustering System | All | 212-288h |
| 75.1 | I3.T0.1 (21.1) | CommitHistoryAnalyzer | One | 24-32h |
| 75.2 | I3.T0.2 (21.2) | CodebaseStructureAnalyzer | One | 28-36h |
| 75.3 | I3.T0.3 (21.3) | DiffDistanceCalculator | One | 32-40h |
| 75.4 | I3.T0.4 (21.4) | BranchClusterer | One(I) | 28-36h |
| 75.5 | I3.T0.5 (21.5) | IntegrationTargetAssigner | Two | 24-32h |
| 75.6 | I3.T0.6 (21.6) | PipelineIntegration | Two | 20-28h |
| 75.7 | I3.T0.7 (21.7) | VisualizationReporting | Three | 20-28h |
| 75.8 | I3.T0.8 (21.8) | TestingSuite | Three | 24-32h |
| 75.9 | I3.T0.9 (21.9) | FrameworkIntegration | All | 16-24h |

**Note:** Task 75 was previously scattered across Task 57. Now unified as single Initiative 3 task with dedicated clean ID 002.

**Refactoring Context:** Task 007 (I2.T4 - Feature Branch Identification) will be merged into Task 002.6 (PipelineIntegration) as an execution mode, eliminating code duplication and improving performance.
