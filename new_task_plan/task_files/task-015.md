## Implementation Details

Gather all existing and newly created documentation: 
1.  **Merge Best Practices (Task 21):** Update to reflect the specific strategies adopted in this framework. 
2.  **Conflict Resolution Procedures:** Detail the manual steps required when the scripts (Task 59, 60) prompt for resolution. 
3.  **Architectural Alignment Strategies:** Outline how to ensure consistency during complex branch integration. 
4.  **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` templates and process (Task 58).** 
5.  **Central `ALIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md` (Task 58).** 
6.  **Usage Guide for Orchestration Script (Task 62):** Provide clear instructions on how to use the main alignment tool. 
Consolidate these into a coherent, accessible format (e.g., a README.md in the repository's root or a dedicated `docs/alignment_guide.md`). Ensure this documentation specifically addresses the needs of a single developer with minimal overhead, focusing on practical steps and troubleshooting.
