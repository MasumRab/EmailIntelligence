# Task 002.3: DiffDistanceCalculator

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 32-40 hours
**Complexity:** 8/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Parent:** Task 002: Branch Clustering System

---

## Purpose

Calculate code distance metrics between feature branches and potential integration targets using various diff algorithms.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Computes file-level diffs between branches
- Calculates similarity scores (Jaccard, edit distance, etc.)
- Identifies changed files, added/removed/changed counts
- Weights changes by significance (core files vs documentation)
- Generates distance vectors for clustering

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Multiple distance metrics implemented
- [ ] Handles large diffs efficiently
- [ ] Weighted scoring for file importance
- [ ] Outputs comparable distance vectors
- [ ] Performance optimized for many branches

---

## Test Strategy

- Compare identical branches (should be distance 0)
- Test with known similarity levels
- Benchmark performance on large repositories
- Validate weighting logic
