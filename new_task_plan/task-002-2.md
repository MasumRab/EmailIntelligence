# Task 002.2: CodebaseStructureAnalyzer

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 28-36 hours
**Complexity:** 8/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Parent:** Task 002: Branch Clustering System

---

## Purpose

Analyze the file structure and code organization of each feature branch to fingerprint its architectural characteristics.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Maps directory structure and file counts per branch
- Identifies language distribution (Python, JS, etc.)
- Detects module boundaries and import patterns
- Generates structural fingerprints for comparison
- Compares against known patterns for main/scientific/orchestration-tools

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Module fingerprints directory structure
- [ ] Detects language and framework usage
- [ ] Maps import dependencies between modules
- [ ] Generates comparison scores against targets
- [ ] Unit tests cover structural analysis

---

## Test Strategy

- Test with branches of varying complexity
- Verify structure detection accuracy
- Test import pattern extraction
- Validate comparison scoring
