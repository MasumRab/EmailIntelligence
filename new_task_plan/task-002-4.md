# Task 002.4: BranchClusterer

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 28-36 hours
**Complexity:** 9/10
**Dependencies:** 002.1, 002.2, 002.3
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Parent:** Task 002: Branch Clustering System

---

## Purpose

Cluster feature branches by similarity using analysis outputs from Subtasks 1-3 to group branches targeting the same integration point.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Combines metrics from CommitHistoryAnalyzer, CodebaseStructureAnalyzer, DiffDistanceCalculator
- Applies clustering algorithm (K-means, hierarchical, or DBSCAN)
- Groups branches by similarity across all dimensions
- Identifies natural cluster boundaries
- Assigns confidence scores to cluster assignments

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Combines all analysis dimensions
- [ ] Implements effective clustering algorithm
- [ ] Produces branch groupings with confidence scores
- [ ] Handles outliers and edge cases
- [ ] Validated against known groupings

---

## Test Strategy

- Use synthetic data with known clusters
- Test with real repository data
- Validate cluster assignments manually
- Test robustness to missing data
