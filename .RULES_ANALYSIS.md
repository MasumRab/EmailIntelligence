## Content Analysis

### Format & Structure
- **Markup:** Markdown with bash/javascript code blocks
- **Content Type:** Configuration guide / ruleset documentation
- **Purpose:** Task Master AI agent integration instructions

### Content Source
`.rules` is **essentially identical to the beginning of `AGENTS.md`**, with one key difference:

**What's in `.rules`:**
- Lines 1-417 (complete file)
- Core Task Master commands and workflows
- Claude Code integration
- MCP setup
- Standard development practices

**What's in `AGENTS.md` but NOT in `.rules`:**
- Lines 3-40: Branch-specific guidance (scientific, main, Jules)
- Environment compatibility notes
- Branch-specific AGENTS_{branch-name}.md files
- Jules IDE warnings

**Relationship:** `.rules` appears to be a **stripped, minimal version** of `AGENTS.md`

## Tool Detection

### By Content Markers

**Evidence for Claude Code generation:**
```
Line 50: "- `CLAUDE.md` - Auto-loaded context for Claude Code (this file)"
Line 72: "├── .claude/"
Line 215: "mcp__task_master_ai__*"
```

**Evidence for Task Master tool:**
```
Lines 8-36: All task-master CLI commands documented
Lines 79-103: MCP server configuration (task-master-ai)
Lines 105-129: Task Master MCP tools reference
```

### Original Tool: **Task Master AI CLI**

The `.rules` file documents:
1. **Task Master CLI commands** - Primary focus
2. **MCP integration** - Task Master provides MCP server
3. **Claude Code integration** - Integrates with Claude Code
4. **Workflow patterns** - Standard agentic development loops

## Creation Hypothesis

### Most Likely Scenario

**Created by:** IDE configuration system or agent context manager  
**Actual source:** Derived from AGENTS.md (likely via automated extraction)  
**When:** November 8-9, 2025  
**Why:** 
- `.rules` is a common pattern for IDE rule files (Cline, Cursor, etc.)
- Stripped version suggests automated filtering
- Contains no branch-specific info (suggests automated minimization)
- Untracked in git (local development artifact)

### Tool That Created It

Three possibilities:

1. **RuleSync** (Rule synchronization tool)
   - Evidence: `.rulesync/` and `.rulesyncignore` exist in repo
   - Purpose matches: Sync rules across IDEs
   - Likely extracted AGENTS.md → .rules

2. **IDE Auto-Configuration** (Cursor, Cline, etc.)
   - Evidence: `.clinerules/`, `.cursor/` directories exist
   - Some IDEs auto-create `.rules` files
   - Context extracted from AGENTS.md

3. **Task Master Initialization**
   - Evidence: `task-master init` command exists
   - Could auto-generate rules from agent guide
   - Less likely given minimal content

## What It Contains

### Documentation Sections
| Section | Lines | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Task Master Commands | 8-36 | CLI reference |
| Project Structure | 38-77 | Directory layout |
| MCP Integration | 79-129 | Server configuration |
| Claude Workflows | 131-207 | Development patterns |
| Tool Allowlist | 209-224 | Claude Code permissions |
| Configuration | 226-252 | Model setup |
| Task Structure | 254-285 | Task ID format |
| Best Practices | 287-337 | Workflow patterns |
| Troubleshooting | 339-370 | Common issues |

### Missing (Compared to AGENTS.md)
- Branch-specific guidance
- Environment compatibility warnings
- Jules IDE information
- Scientific/main branch differences

## Current Status

**Should it be tracked in git?**

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Configuration guide (local reference) |
| **Change frequency** | Low (static documentation) |
| **Repo ownership** | Belongs in repo for consistency |
| **Branch relevance** | Common across all branches |
| **Current state** | Untracked (development artifact) |

**Recommendation:** Add to git if it's a standard IDE rule file, keep untracked if auto-generated.

## Conclusion

**Created:** November 8-9, 2025 (likely automated)  
**By:** IDE rule generator or RuleSync tool  
**Purpose:** Provide stripped-down Task Master rules for IDE integration  
**Status:** Local development artifact, not tracked in git  
**Action:** Determine if RuleSync should create/manage this file, or if it's redundant with existing tracked rule files

## Hash Verification

To verify no external modifications:
```bash
echo "5051392a2a6d7b831f4050eabe28da90  .rules" | md5sum -c
```

Expected: `OK`
