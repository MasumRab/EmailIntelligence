# Repository Planning Graph (RPG) Method - Ultra Enhanced Reverse Engineered PRD

This PRD was automatically generated from existing task markdown files to recreate the original requirements that would generate these tasks when processed by task-master. This version implements ultra enhanced improvements for superior parsing fidelity.

<overview>
## Problem Statement
[Based on the tasks identified in the existing task files, this project aims to address specific development needs that were originally outlined in a Product Requirements Document.]

## Target Users
[Users who benefit from the functionality described in the tasks]

## Success Metrics
[Metrics that would validate the successful completion of the tasks]

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: [Foundation Name]
**Goal**: [What foundational capability this establishes]

**Entry Criteria**: [What must be true before starting]

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement ID: 1 (ID: 001)

**Exit Criteria**: [Observable outcome that proves phase complete]

**Delivers**: [What can users/developers do after this phase?]

## Critical Test Scenarios

### ID: 1
**Happy path**:
- [Successfully implement ID: 1]
- Expected: [Task completed successfully]

**Error cases**:
- [Failure to implement ID: 1]
- Expected: [Proper error handling]

<risks>
## Technical Risks
**Risk**: Complexity of implementing all identified tasks
- **Impact**: High - Could delay project timeline
- **Likelihood**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Break tasks into smaller subtasks
- **Fallback**: Prioritize critical tasks first
</risks>

# How Task Master Uses This PRD

This PRD was generated to recreate the original requirements that would produce the same tasks when processed by task-master. It implements ultra enhanced improvements for superior parsing fidelity.
