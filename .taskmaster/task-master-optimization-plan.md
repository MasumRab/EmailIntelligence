## Phase 3: Workflow Implementation 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Objectives
- Implement systematic execution patterns
- Use autopilot for complex task implementation
- Establish TDD workflow for all development tasks

### Specific Actions

#### 3.1 Implement Autopilot for High-Complexity Tasks
- ✅ **STARTED**: Task 1 autopilot initiated (RED phase - writing failing tests)
- **Plan**: Apply to Tasks 3, 4, 6, and 7
- **Benefits**: Enforces TDD methodology, systematic implementation

#### 3.2 Establish Systematic Execution Patterns
- **Pattern 1**: Research → Scope → Autopilot (for complex tasks)
- **Pattern 2**: Next Task → Status Updates → Validation (for workflow management)

#### 3.3 Create Task Implementation Templates
- **Template A**: Backend tasks (recovery, migration, refactoring)
- **Template B**: Security tasks (RBAC, MFA, session management)
- **Template C**: Alignment tasks (branch merging, validation)

#### 3.4 Integrate with Development Workflow
- **Git Integration**: Autopilot creates feature branches automatically
- **CI/CD Integration**: Task 7 will validate merge processes
- **Code Review**: Task completion triggers review processes

### Success Criteria
- [x] Task 1 autopilot workflow established
