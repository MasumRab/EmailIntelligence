# EmailIntelligence Python Environment Management

This document provides a summary of the Python Environment Management implementation for the EmailIntelligence project.

## Overview and Recommended Setup

The primary method for setting up and managing the Python environment for EmailIntelligence is through the main launcher script, `launch.py`. This script automates several key processes:

*   **Virtual Environment Creation**: Automatically creates a Python virtual environment (named `venv` by default) to isolate project dependencies.
*   **Dependency Installation**: Installs required Python packages from predefined requirements files.
*   **NLTK Data Download**: Ensures necessary NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) data is available.
*   **Application Launching**: Serves as the main entry point to run the application, tests, and other utilities.

**Note on `setup_python.sh`:**
The shell script `scripts/setup_python.sh` is now considered a **legacy script**. While it might offer some initial system-level setup (like ensuring Python and pip are installed), **`launch.py` is the recommended and comprehensive tool for creating and managing the project's Python virtual environment and dependencies.** Users should prioritize using `launch.py` for environment setup.

## Key Components Managed by `launch.py`

### 1. Unified Launcher System (`launch.py`)

`launch.py` is the central script for all environment and application management tasks. It handles:
- Command-line argument parsing.
- Orchestrating environment setup steps.
- Launching the application, backend, frontend, or tests.

*(Platform-specific launchers like `launch.bat` or `launch.sh` are thin wrappers that primarily invoke `python launch.py`)*

### 2. Environment Management (via `launch.py`)

`launch.py` directly manages the Python environment to ensure consistency:

- **Virtual Environment Management**:
    - Creates a virtual environment named `venv` in the project root if it doesn't exist (unless `--no-venv` is used).
    - Activates this venv for application execution.
- **Dependency Management Strategy**:
    - **Base Dependencies**:
        - `launch.py` first looks for `requirements_versions.txt`. If found, dependencies listed here (expected to be pinned versions) are installed.
        - If `requirements_versions.txt` is not found, it falls back to `requirements.txt` for base dependencies.
    - **Stage-Specific Dependencies**:
        - For `dev` stage (`--stage dev`): After base dependencies, packages from `requirements-dev.txt` are installed (if the file exists).
        - For `test` stage (`--stage test`): After base dependencies, packages from `requirements-test.txt` are installed (if the file exists).
    - The `--update-deps` flag forces an update (upgrade) of existing packages during installation.
- **Python Version Checking**: Ensures the Python version being used is within the supported range.
- **NLTK Data Download**: Automatically attempts to download required NLTK datasets.
- **System Information**: The `--system-info` flag provides detailed diagnostics about the Python environment, OS, hardware, and project configuration.
- **Log Level Control**: The `--loglevel` flag allows users to set the verbosity of the launcher script (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).

**Behavior of `--no-venv`:**
If the `--no-venv` flag is used, `launch.py`:
1.  Will **not** create or use a virtual environment.
2.  Will **skip all Python dependency installation steps** (from `requirements.txt`, `requirements_versions.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, etc.).
Users who choose this option are fully responsible for ensuring their Python environment has all necessary dependencies installed and correctly configured. This option is generally intended for advanced users or specific deployment scenarios where manual environment management is preferred.

### 3. Extensions Framework

The extensions framework allows for modular enhancements to the application:

- **Extension Discovery**: Automatically discovers available extensions
- **Extension Lifecycle**: Handles loading, initialization, and shutdown of extensions
- **Extension Management**: Supports installing, updating, and uninstalling extensions
- **Configuration Management**: Provides configuration options for extensions

### 4. Models Management

The models management system handles machine learning models used by the application:

- **Model Download**: Downloads models from URLs
- **Model Verification**: Verifies model integrity using checksums
- **Model Configuration**: Manages configuration for different models
- **Model Lifecycle**: Handles loading and unloading of models

### 5. Application Execution

The application execution system runs the application in different modes and stages:

- **Development Mode**: Runs the application with hot-reloading for quick development
- **Testing Mode**: Runs the application in a testing environment
- **Staging Mode**: Runs the application in a staging environment
- **Production Mode**: Runs the application in a production environment

### 6. Testing Framework

The testing framework provides comprehensive testing capabilities:

- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Tests component interactions
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tests the entire application
- **Performance Testing**: Tests application performance
- **Security Testing**: Tests application security

## Implementation Details

### Launcher Script Features (Relevant to Environment)

`launch.py` offers several command-line arguments to control its behavior regarding environment setup:

- **`--no-venv`**: Skips virtual environment creation/use and all Python dependency installations.
- **`--update-deps`**: Forces an update of dependencies during installation.
- **`--skip-python-version-check`**: Bypasses the Python version compatibility check.
- **`--no-download-nltk`**: Skips the automatic download of NLTK data.
- **`--system-info`**: Prints detailed system and environment information and exits.
- **`--loglevel {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}`**: Sets the logging verbosity for the launcher.

*(For a full list of launcher arguments, see `LAUNCHER.md` or run `python launch.py --help`)*

## Extension System

The extension system allows for modular enhancements to the application. Extensions are discovered automatically and loaded at runtime. Each extension can provide additional functionality or modify existing functionality.

### Extension Structure

An extension consists of the following files:

- **Main Module**: Contains the extension code
- **Metadata File**: Contains information about the extension
- **README File**: Contains documentation for the extension
- **Requirements File**: Contains dependencies for the extension

### Extension Lifecycle

Extensions go through the following lifecycle:

1. **Discovery**: Extensions are discovered in the extensions directory
2. **Loading**: Extension modules are loaded into memory
3. **Initialization**: Extensions are initialized with configuration
4. **Execution**: Extensions provide functionality during application execution
5. **Shutdown**: Extensions are properly shut down when the application exits

### Creating Extensions

New extensions can be created using the `--create-extension` argument:

```bash
python launch.py --create-extension my_extension
```

This creates a template for a new extension with the necessary files.

## Conclusion

The environment management system, centered around `launch.py`, provides a robust and automated way to ensure consistent Python environments for the EmailIntelligence project. Users are encouraged to rely on `launch.py` for setup and execution.
This implementation integrates functionalities previously handled by separate modules, streamlining the process.
