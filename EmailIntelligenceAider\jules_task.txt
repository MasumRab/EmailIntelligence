Execute Task 11.4: Security Testing & Validation. Work in scientific branch which contains comprehensive security testing suite, vulnerability scanning tools, and compliance validation framework.

Specific Implementation Steps:
1. Security Scanning Tool Setup: Install and configure bandit, safety, and dependency-check for automated vulnerability scanning
2. Automated Security Scans: Implement daily automated scans for Python code security (bandit), dependency vulnerabilities (safety), and static security analysis
3. Vulnerability Assessment: Run comprehensive vulnerability scanning across all modules
4. Compliance Validation Framework: Implement GDPR/SOC2 compliance checking for data handling
5. Security Test Suite Execution: Run all security tests (test_security.py, test_security_integration.py, node_engine security tests)
6. Audit Verification: Implement automated audit trail validation and integrity checks
7. Penetration Testing Setup: Configure basic penetration testing capabilities for API endpoints
8. Manual Security Testing: Execute manual security reviews for authentication flows, authorization logic, input validation, and session management
9. Compliance Audits: Perform compliance validation for data protection and privacy requirements
10. Security Monitoring Integration: Set up real-time security event monitoring and alerting
11. Security Documentation: Generate comprehensive security audit reports and compliance documentation
12. CI/CD Security Integration: Add security scanning to GitHub Actions pipeline (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Success Criteria:
- Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities
- All security tests passing
- Compliance requirements validated
- Automated security scanning implemented
- Security audit reports generated
- Real-time monitoring active

## Task-Master Analysis Summary

CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Backend migration structurally complete (44+ modules in src/backend/)
- ✅ Security framework integrated (RBAC, MFA, audit logging)
- ⚠️ Missing automated security scanning tools
- ⚠️ Needs comprehensive integration validation

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
- Parallel Execution: Both tasks can run simultaneously (max 3 concurrent)
- Order: 11.2 first for backend stability, then 11.4 for security validation
- Dependencies: Both leverage scientific branch's advanced infrastructure

ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- Add bandit, safety, pip-audit to requirements-dev.txt
- Integrate security scanning into CI/CD pipeline
- Create SECURITY_AUDIT.md documentation
- Implement real-time security monitoring

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Work in scientific branch (primary execution branch)
- Quality gates: 90% test coverage, security scans required
- Use scientific branch's comprehensive testing infrastructure (90+ test files)
- Parallel execution capability (up to 3 concurrent tasks)

VALIDATION FRAMEWORK:
- Code Quality: linting_passed, type_checking_passed, documentation_updated
- Testing: unit_tests_passed, integration_tests_passed, coverage_met
- Functionality: smoke_tests_passed, feature_tests_passed, regression_tests_passed
- Security: security_scan_passed, vulnerability_check_passed
- Performance: benchmarks_met, load_tests_passed

FINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- All tasks completed successfully
- Scientific branch fully leveraged
- 90% test coverage achieved
- Security framework comprehensive
- Performance optimized
- CI/CD pipeline automated
- Documentation complete
- Parallel execution verified
