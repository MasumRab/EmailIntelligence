    *   Corrected command arguments for `smart_retrieval.py` invocation.
*   **Unfinished Aspects:**
    *   **Comprehensive Test Environment Setup:** The assumption of external environment setup for `test_stages.py` needs explicit documentation or integration into the testing pipeline.
    *   **Refined Test Paths:** Integration and API test paths might be too broad.
    *   **User-Friendly Pydantic Validation Error Handling:** Still results in generic 500 errors; a 422 with detailed validation messages is preferred.
    *   **Full NLP Engine Delegation:** Only sentiment analysis is fully delegated; topic, intent, and urgency need similar refactoring.
    *   **Unresolved Database Migration Issues:** Carried over from previous WIPs.
