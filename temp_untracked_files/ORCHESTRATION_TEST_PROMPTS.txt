PROMPT 1 - Basic Strategy
What is Strategy 5 and when should we use it?

---

PROMPT 2 - Emergency Detection
Our team just noticed we're getting 2-3 duplicate PRs even though the debounce file exists. What should we do?

---

PROMPT 3 - Context Contamination
After running the validation script on orchestration-tools branch, we got:
✗ CRITICAL: Found 'plugins/' (should not exist on orchestration-tools)
✗ CRITICAL: Found 'AGENTS.md' (should be on main, not orchestration-tools)
What happened and how do we fix it?

---

PROMPT 4 - Branch Roles
I need to understand the three orchestration branches. What goes on each one and why are they separate?

---

PROMPT 5 - Strategy 7 Activation
We want to enable Strategy 7 (hybrid) as a backup. Walk me through the steps to activate it on the orchestration-tools branch.

---

PROMPT 6 - Debounce Configuration
Our debounce timeout is set to 5 seconds, but we're seeing duplicate PRs created because pushes come in waves faster than 5 seconds. How do we fix this?

---

PROMPT 7 - Quick Command Check
I need to check if debounce is currently active right now. What command do I run?

---

PROMPT 8 - Rollback Decision
Everything is failing. We need to undo Strategy 5 completely without losing work on main. What's the fastest option?

---

PROMPT 9 - Monitoring Checklist
Create a daily monitoring checklist that a team should run to ensure Strategy 5 is working correctly. What 4 commands should be in it?

---

PROMPT 10 - Scenario Walkthrough
Walk me through what happens step-by-step when a developer makes 5 commits and pushes them to orchestration-tools-changes in quick succession (all within 5 seconds).

---

PROMPT 11 - Advanced Failure Mode
We're experiencing a race condition where two pushes happen simultaneously (within <100ms). Strategy 5 sometimes creates 2 PRs instead of 1. Which strategy should we switch to and why?

---

PROMPT 12 - Integration Question
If I merge orchestration-tools into main right now, what files would be lost from main? Should we ever do a full branch merge?

---

SCORING GUIDE:
90-100% = Ready for production
80-89% = Mostly ready (minor gaps)
70-79% = Needs more context
<70% = Documentation unclear
