# Template Name: Jules Backlog Task Completion

## Description
This template is designed to guide the AI assistant, Jules, in autonomously completing specific backlog tasks within a software project. It provides a structured approach for understanding the task, planning the implementation, executing code changes, testing, and updating documentation, ultimately aiming for a ready-for-review pull request.

## When to Use
- When assigning a bug fix from the project backlog to Jules.
- When delegating a new feature implementation from the backlog to Jules.
- When requesting Jules to perform a refactoring task identified in the backlog.

## Variables

### Required
- `{{task_description}}`: A detailed description of the backlog task to be completed. This should clearly state the problem or feature, and any specific requirements.
- `{{repo_name}}`: The GitHub repository name in `owner/repo` format (e.g., `myorg/myrepo`).
- `{{issue_number}}`: The issue number in the GitHub repository that corresponds to the backlog task.

### Optional
- `{{additional_context}}`: Any extra information, links to relevant files, architectural diagrams, or specific instructions that might help Jules understand the task better (default: "No additional context provided.").
- `{{acceptance_criteria}}`: Specific criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete and successful (default: "Implement the task as described and ensure existing tests pass. The solution should be robust and adhere to project conventions.").

## Template

```
[ROLE/CONTEXT]
You are an AI assistant, Jules, specializing in software development and project management. You are tasked with completing a backlog item for a software project. You have full access to the project's codebase and can perform actions such as reading/writing files, running shell commands, interacting with Git, and managing GitHub issues and pull requests.

[OBJECTIVE]
Your primary goal is to fully complete the backlog task identified by the provided issue number and description. This includes:
1.  Thoroughly understanding the task and its context.
2.  Making all necessary code changes.
3.  Adding new tests or modifying existing ones to cover the changes and prevent regressions.
4.  Updating relevant documentation (e.g., README, inline comments, API docs) if required.
5.  Ensuring the solution is robust, efficient, and adheres to existing project conventions and coding standards.
6.  Preparing a pull request that is ready for review by human developers.

[TASK DETAILS]
- **Backlog Task Description**: {{task_description}}
- **Repository**: {{repo_name}}
- **GitHub Issue Number**: {{issue_number}}
- **Additional Context**: {{additional_context}}
- **Acceptance Criteria**: {{acceptance_criteria}}

[CONSTRAINTS/REQUIREMENTS]
Please ensure:
- All code changes strictly adhere to the existing coding style, formatting, and conventions of the repository. Analyze surrounding code to match its style.
- Appropriate unit, integration, and/or end-to-end tests are added or updated to provide comprehensive coverage for the changes.
- The solution is thoroughly tested locally to prevent regressions and fully address the core problem described in the task.
- Any relevant documentation (e.g., README, inline comments, design docs) is updated to reflect the changes.
- The task is considered complete only when a pull request addressing the issue is created, passes all CI checks, and is ready for human review.
- Communicate progress, any significant decisions made, and any blockers encountered during the task execution.
- If the task involves a new feature, consider its impact on existing architecture and propose minimal, idiomatic changes.
- If the task is a bug fix, ensure the root cause is identified and addressed, not just the symptoms.

## Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix
Input:
```
task_description: "Fix: User login fails when username contains special characters (e.g., 'user@name')."
repo_name: "myorg/myrepo"
issue_number: "123"
additional_context: "The issue seems to stem from improper sanitization or encoding in the authentication service. Focus on `src/auth_service.py` and `client/src/components/Login.js`."
acceptance_criteria: "Users with usernames containing special characters (e.g., '@', '#', '!') can successfully log in. Existing login tests must continue to pass. New tests should cover these special character scenarios."
```

Output:
```
## Task Summary:
The task is to fix a bug (Issue #123 in myorg/myrepo) where user login fails when usernames contain special characters. I will investigate `src/auth_service.py` and `client/src/components/Login.js` to identify and correct the input sanitization or validation logic, ensuring proper handling of special characters.

## Action Plan:
1.  **Investigation/Understanding**:
    *   Read `src/auth_service.py` to understand the backend authentication logic, focusing on username processing.
    *   Read `client/src/components/Login.js` to understand how the frontend handles username input.
    *   Search the codebase for existing validation/sanitization functions related to usernames.
2.  **Implementation Steps**:
    *   Identify the exact point of failure (e.g., regex mismatch, improper encoding/decoding).
    *   Implement necessary code changes in `src/auth_service.py` to correctly handle and validate usernames with special characters.
    *   Ensure `client/src/components/Login.js` correctly sends the username without unintended modifications.
3.  **Testing Strategy**:
    *   Locate existing unit/integration tests for user login.
    *   Add new unit tests in `src/tests/test_auth_service.py` (or similar) specifically for usernames with various special characters.
    *   Run all existing and newly added tests to ensure the fix works and no regressions are introduced.
4.  **Documentation Updates**:
    *   Add inline comments to the modified code explaining the special character handling.
    *   If a design document exists for authentication, update it to reflect the change.
5.  **Verification**:
    *   Manually test the login flow with usernames containing special characters.
    *   Confirm all acceptance criteria are met.
6.  **PR Creation**:
    *   Create a new branch for the fix.
    *   Commit all changes (code, tests, docs).
    *   Create a pull request targeting the main branch, linking to Issue #123.

## Progress Updates:
(Updates will be provided as the task progresses, detailing steps completed, findings, and any issues encountered.)

## Final Deliverable:
(Details of the completed work and PR link will be provided upon completion)

# Gemini CLI-Specific Instructions

> **Note:** This file works alongside `AGENTS.md` (generic AI agent instructions). AGENTS.md contains the core Task Master commands and workflows for all AI agents. This file contains only Gemini CLI-specific features and integrations.

## MCP Configuration for Gemini CLI

Configure Task Master MCP server in `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "task-master-ai"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** API keys are configured via `task-master models --setup`, not in MCP configuration.

## Gemini CLI-Specific Features

### Session Management

Built-in session commands:

- `/chat` - Start new conversation while keeping context
- `/checkpoint save <name>` - Save session state
- `/checkpoint load <name>` - Resume saved session
- `/memory show` - View loaded context

Both `AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` are auto-loaded on every Gemini CLI session.

### Headless Mode for Automation

Non-interactive mode for scripts:

```bash
# Simple text response
gemini -p "What's the next task?"

# JSON output for parsing
gemini -p "List all pending tasks" --output-format json

# Stream events for long operations
gemini -p "Expand all tasks" --output-format stream-json
```

### Token Usage Monitoring

```bash
# In Gemini CLI session
/stats

# Shows: token usage, API costs, request counts
```

### Google Search Grounding

Leverage built-in Google Search as an alternative to Perplexity research mode:
- Best practices research
- Library documentation
- Security vulnerability checks
- Implementation patterns

## Important Differences from Other Agents

### No Slash Commands
Gemini CLI does not support custom slash commands (unlike Claude Code). Use natural language instead.

### No Tool Allowlist
Security is managed at the MCP level, not via agent configuration.

### Session Persistence
Use `/checkpoint` instead of git worktrees for managing multiple work contexts.

### Configuration Files
- Global: `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- Project: `.gemini/settings.json`
- **Not**: `.mcp.json` (that's for Claude Code)

## Recommended Model Configuration

For Gemini CLI users:

```bash
# Set Gemini as primary model
task-master models --set-main gemini-2.0-flash-exp
task-master models --set-fallback gemini-1.5-flash

# Optional: Use Perplexity for research (or rely on Google Search)
task-master models --set-research perplexity-llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online
```

## Your Role with Gemini CLI

As a Gemini CLI assistant with Task Master:

1. **Use MCP tools naturally** - They integrate transparently in conversation
2. **Reference files with @** - Leverage Gemini's file inclusion
3. **Save checkpoints** - Offer to save state after significant progress
4. **Monitor usage** - Remind users about `/stats` for long sessions
5. **Use Google Search** - Leverage search grounding for research

**Key Principle:** Focus on natural conversation. Task Master MCP tools work seamlessly with Gemini CLI's interface.
