# Phased Branch Cleanup Plan

## Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup (Week 1)
### Goals
- Remove obviously obsolete branches
- Validate current branch status

### Actions
1. Delete merged branches that are no longer needed:
   ```bash
   git branch -d fix-search-in-category
   ```

2. Verify which branches are truly obsolete by checking:
   - Last commit date
   - Associated PR status
   - Branch content relevance

3. Document any branches that should be preserved despite being old

### Success Criteria
- 1+ merged branches removed
- Clear understanding of which branches are obsolete
- No disruption to active development

## Phase 2: Naming Standardization (Week 2)
### Goals
- Apply new branch naming standards
- Migrate legacy-named branches

### Actions
1. Run branch rename migration script with dry-run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/branch_rename_migration.py --dry-run
   ```

2. Review migration plan and identify any branches requiring manual handling

3. Execute migration for branches that are safe to rename:
   ```bash
   python scripts/branch_rename_migration.py --execute
   ```

4. Update any documentation or CI/CD references to renamed branches

### Success Criteria
- All legacy-named branches follow new standards
- Branch validation script passes for all renamed branches
- No broken references to old branch names

## Phase 3: Active Branch Review (Week 3)
### Goals
- Review remaining old branches for relevance
- Coordinate with team on branch status

### Actions
1. Review branches older than 30 days that are not merged:
   - Check associated PRs/Issues
   - Verify if work is still relevant
   - Coordinate with branch owners

2. Archive or delete obsolete branches that are still active

3. Create a temporary backup branch before cleanup if needed:
   ```bash
   git checkout branch-name
   git checkout -b backup-branch-name
   git push origin backup-branch-name
   ```

### Success Criteria
- All obsolete branches removed
- Active branches confirmed as still needed
- Proper backups made for anything preserved

## Phase 4: Implementation and Validation (Week 4)
### Goals
- Complete cleanup implementation
- Establish validation process

### Actions
1. Execute final cleanup:
   ```bash
   # Remove merged branches (excluding protected ones)
   git branch --merged | grep -v "\*\|main\|scientific\|develop" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
   ```

2. Validate all remaining branches follow naming standards:
   ```bash
   # Run validation on each remaining branch
   git branch | grep -v "\*\|main\|scientific\|develop" | while read branch; do
     python scripts/validate_branch_name.py $branch
   done
   ```

3. Update team on cleanup results and new naming standards

### Success Criteria
- Repository has clean branch structure
- All branches follow naming standards
- Team aware of naming requirements for future branches

## Phase 5: Maintenance and Prevention (Ongoing)
### Goals
- Maintain clean branch structure
- Prevent accumulation of obsolete branches

### Actions
1. Implement regular cleanup routine (monthly)
2. Add branch validation to CI/CD or pre-commit hooks
3. Update CONTRIBUTING.md with cleanup procedures
4. Schedule periodic reviews of branch list

### Success Criteria
- Regular maintenance schedule established
- New branches follow standards automatically
- Branch list remains manageable

## Rollback Plan
If cleanup causes issues:
1. Restore from remote if necessary
2. Use `git reflog` to recover accidentally deleted branches
3. Recreate important branches from local copies if available

## Communication Plan
- Notify team before each phase
- Provide advance notice for scheduled cleanup
- Update documentation as changes are made
- Provide guidance on new naming standards
