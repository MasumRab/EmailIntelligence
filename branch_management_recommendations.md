# Branch Management Recommendations for EmailIntelligence

## Current State Analysis

The repository currently has a complex branch structure with:
- 5 local branches
- 57 remote branches
- Multiple naming conventions
- Several orphaned/obsolete branches
- A primary development branch (`scientific`) that differs from the default `main` branch

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Branch Proliferation**: There are too many branches (57 remote branches), making it difficult to understand the current state of development.

2. **Inconsistent Naming**: Branches follow different naming patterns:
   - `feature/*` (e.g., `feature-notmuch-integration`)
   - `feat/*` (e.g., `feat/gradio-layered-ui-foundation`)
   - `fix/*` (e.g., `fix/launch-bat-issues`)
   - `refactor/*` (e.g., `refactor/python-nlp-testing`)
   - Direct naming without prefixes (e.g., `scientific`, `backup-branch`)

3. **Orphaned Branches**: Many branches appear to be stale or abandoned, with no recent activity.

4. **Default Branch Mismatch**: The repository's default branch is `main`, but active development happens on `scientific`.

## Recommendations

### 1. Branch Naming Standardization

Adopt a consistent naming convention:
- `feature/short-description` for new features
- `bugfix/short-description` for bug fixes
- `hotfix/short-description` for urgent production fixes
- `refactor/short-description` for refactoring work
- `docs/short-description` for documentation changes

### 2. Branch Lifecycle Management

Implement a formal branch lifecycle:
1. **Create**: Branch from the latest `main` (or designated development branch)
2. **Develop**: Work on the feature/fix
3. **Review**: Create a pull request for code review
4. **Merge**: Merge to the target branch after approval
5. **Delete**: Remove the branch after merging

### 3. Branch Cleanup

Perform regular cleanup of obsolete branches:
- Delete branches merged to `main`
- Archive or delete branches with no activity for > 3 months
- Consolidate similar-purpose branches

### 4. Default Branch Alignment

Consider making `scientific` the default branch if that's where active development occurs, or merge `scientific` back to `main` to reduce confusion.

### 5. Branch Protection

Implement branch protection rules:
- Require pull requests for changes to `main`
- Require code reviews before merging
- Require passing CI checks

## Implementation Plan

1. Document the branch naming convention in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
2. Set up branch protection rules on GitHub
3. Schedule monthly branch cleanup sessions
4. Align team on the new branching strategy
5. Update any CI/CD pipelines to reflect branch changes
