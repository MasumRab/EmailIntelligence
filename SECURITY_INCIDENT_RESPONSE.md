# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for responding to security incidents in the Email Intelligence Platform.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

- **High**: Security vulnerability exploitation, DDoS attacks, malware infection
- **Medium**: Unauthorized access attempts, suspicious activity, policy violations
- **Low**: Minor security events, false positives, informational alerts

## Response Procedures

### 1. Detection and Assessment (0-15 minutes)
- Security monitoring systems alert on suspicious activity
- Incident response team assesses severity and impact
- Determine if incident is confirmed or false positive

### 2. Containment (15-60 minutes)
- Isolate affected systems
- Disable compromised accounts
- Implement emergency access controls
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis

### 3. Investigation (1-4 hours)

- Analyze attack vectors and impact
- Identify root cause and vulnerabilities exploited
- Document findings

### 4. Recovery (4-24 hours)
- Clean and restore affected systems
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Restore services gradually
- Monitor for reoccurrence

### 5. Post-Incident Review (1-7 days)
- Conduct thorough debriefing
- Update security measures and procedures
- Implement lessons learned
- Report to stakeholders if required

## Communication Plan
