      Timeline: 1-2 months
      Effort: 2-5 days


SUMMARY BY RISK LEVEL
------------------------------
MEDIUM: 9 issues

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------
1. Prioritize CRITICAL and HIGH risk issues immediately
2. Schedule MEDIUM risk issues for the next development cycle
3. Plan regular code reviews to prevent new technical debt
4. Implement automated code quality checks in CI/CD pipeline
5. Establish coding standards and guidelines for the team
