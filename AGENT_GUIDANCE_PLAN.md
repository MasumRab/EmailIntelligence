# Agent Guidance Plan: Backlog, Task-Master-AI, and GitHub

## Overview
This plan provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents working with three primary tools: Backlog, Task-Master-AI, and GitHub. Agents need clear instructions on usage, integration, and best practices for each tool.

## Tool Guidance

### 1. Backlog
**Purpose**: Project management and issue tracking
**Key Features**:
- Issue creation and management
- Sprint planning
- Time tracking
- Team collaboration

**Agent Guidance**:
- Use Backlog for tracking development tasks
- Create issues for bugs, features, and improvements
- Link issues to code changes
- Update status regularly

### 2. Task-Master-AI
**Purpose**: AI-powered task management and code generation
**Key Features**:
- Automated task breakdown
- Code generation assistance
- Project planning
- Quality assurance

**Agent Guidance**:
- Leverage for complex task decomposition
- Use for code review and suggestions
- Integrate with development workflow
- Maintain code quality standards

### 3. GitHub
**Purpose**: Version control and collaboration platform
**Key Features**:
- Repository management
- Pull requests and code review
- Issue tracking
- CI/CD integration

**Agent Guidance**:
- Follow GitHub flow for contributions
- Create meaningful commit messages
- Use pull requests for code changes
- Participate in code reviews

## Integration Strategy

### Workflow Integration
1. **Task Initiation**: Use Task-Master-AI to break down requirements
2. **Issue Creation**: Create Backlog issues for tasks
3. **Development**: Use GitHub for version control
4. **Code Review**: Leverage Task-Master-AI for quality checks
5. **Deployment**: Update Backlog and GitHub statuses

### Communication Guidelines
- Maintain clear documentation
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Provide regular status updates
- Ensure cross-tool synchronization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Create tool-specific documentation
- [ ] Establish integration workflows
- [ ] Set up monitoring and reporting

### Phase 2: Agent Training
- [ ] Develop agent prompts for each tool
- [ ] Create usage examples and templates
- [ ] Implement error handling procedures

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test agent-tool interactions
- [ ] Validate workflow efficiency
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate

### Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring
- [ ] Roll out to production environment
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Provide ongoing support and updates

## Success Metrics
- Reduced task completion time
- Improved code quality
- Enhanced team collaboration
- Higher user satisfaction

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular backup of configurations
- Fallback procedures for tool failures
- Clear escalation paths
- Documentation maintenance
