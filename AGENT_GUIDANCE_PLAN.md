# Task Master AI - Agent Guidance Plan

## Overview
This plan provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents working with Task Master AI. Agents need clear instructions on usage, integration, and best practices for Task Master AI workflows.

## Task Master AI Guidance

### Purpose
AI-powered task management and development workflow orchestration

### Key Features
- Automated task breakdown and planning
- Code generation assistance
- Project complexity analysis
- Dependency management
- Research-backed task creation
- Multi-agent workflow coordination

### Agent Guidance
- Use Task Master for all development task management
- Leverage AI for complex task decomposition
- Integrate with version control workflows
- Maintain code quality through structured task completion
- Use research capabilities for informed decision making
- Coordinate with other agents through task dependencies

## Integration Strategy

### Workflow Integration
1. **Project Setup**: Initialize Task Master and parse PRDs
2. **Task Planning**: Use AI to analyze complexity and expand tasks
3. **Development**: Work through tasks systematically with status tracking
4. **Code Review**: Leverage Task Master for quality assurance
5. **Completion**: Mark tasks done and update documentation

### Communication Guidelines
- Maintain clear task documentation
- Use consistent task naming conventions
- Provide regular status updates
- Ensure task dependency synchronization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Create tool-specific documentation
- [ ] Establish integration workflows
- [ ] Set up monitoring and reporting

### Phase 2: Agent Training
- [ ] Develop agent prompts for each tool
- [ ] Create usage examples and templates
- [ ] Implement error handling procedures

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test agent-tool interactions
- [ ] Validate workflow efficiency
- [ ] Gather feedback and iterate

### Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring
- [ ] Roll out to production environment
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Provide ongoing support and updates

## Success Metrics
- Reduced task completion time
- Improved code quality
- Enhanced team collaboration
- Higher user satisfaction

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular backup of configurations
- Fallback procedures for tool failures
- Clear escalation paths
- Documentation maintenance
