# Task 002.3: DiffDistanceCalculator

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 32-40 hours
**Complexity:** 8/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Created:** 2026-01-12
**Parent:** Task 002: Branch Clustering System

---

## Purpose

Calculate code distance metrics between feature branches and potential integration targets using various diff algorithms.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Computes file-level diffs between branches
- Calculates similarity scores (Jaccard, edit distance, etc.)
- Identifies changed files, added/removed/changed counts
- Weights changes by significance (core files vs documentation)
- Generates distance vectors for clustering

---

## Guidance & Standards

- **Architecture:** [Comprehensive Guide](../guidance/COMPREHENSIVE_CLI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)
- **Merging:** [Merge Guidance](../guidance/MERGE_GUIDANCE_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- **Patterns:** [Factory Pattern](../guidance/FACTORY_PATTERN_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- **General:** [Project Guidance](../guidance/README.md)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Multiple distance metrics implemented
- [ ] Handles large diffs efficiently
- [ ] Weighted scoring for file importance
- [ ] Outputs comparable distance vectors
- [ ] Performance optimized for many branches

---

## Test Strategy

- Compare identical branches (should be distance 0)
- Test with known similarity levels
- Benchmark performance on large repositories
- Validate weighting logic
