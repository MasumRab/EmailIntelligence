## Purpose

Assign optimal integration targets (main, scientific, orchestration-tools) to each feature branch based on clustering results and Task 001 criteria.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Takes clustered branches and metrics as input
- Applies Task 001 framework criteria to refine assignments
- Calculates confidence scores for each target assignment
- Generates justification for recommendations
- Outputs categorized_branches.json

- **General:** [Project Guidance](../guidance/README.md)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Assigns targets to all feature branches
- [ ] Provides confidence scores per assignment
- [ ] Generates justification documentation
- [ ] Integrates with Task 001 criteria
- [ ] Outputs standard JSON format

---

## Test Strategy
