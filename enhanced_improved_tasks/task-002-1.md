# Task 002.1: CommitHistoryAnalyzer

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 24-32 hours
**Complexity:** 7/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Created:** 2026-01-12
**Parent:** Task 002: Branch Clustering System

---

## Purpose

Analyze Git commit history for each feature branch to extract metrics like commit frequency, author patterns, merge points, and branch divergence dates.

---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Fetches all remote feature branches
- Extracts commit metadata (hash, date, author, message)
- Calculates divergence metrics from main/scientific/orchestration-tools
- Identifies shared history points and merge bases
- Outputs structured metrics for clustering

---

## Guidance & Standards

- **Architecture:** [Comprehensive Guide](../guidance/COMPREHENSIVE_CLI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)
- **Merging:** [Merge Guidance](../guidance/MERGE_GUIDANCE_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- **Patterns:** [Factory Pattern](../guidance/FACTORY_PATTERN_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
- **General:** [Project Guidance](../guidance/README.md)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Module fetches and analyzes all feature branches
- [ ] Generates commit history metrics for each branch
- [ ] Identifies merge bases with all primary targets
- [ ] Outputs structured JSON for downstream processing
- [ ] Unit tests cover all extraction functions

---

## Test Strategy

- Create test repository with known branch structures
- Verify metrics match expected values
- Test with empty branches, single commits, long histories

---
