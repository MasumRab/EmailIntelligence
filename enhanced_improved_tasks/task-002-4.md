---

## Details

Implement a Python module that:
- Combines metrics from CommitHistoryAnalyzer, CodebaseStructureAnalyzer, DiffDistanceCalculator
- Applies clustering algorithm (K-means, hierarchical, or DBSCAN)
- Groups branches by similarity across all dimensions
- Identifies natural cluster boundaries
- Assigns confidence scores to cluster assignments

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Combines all analysis dimensions
- [ ] Implements effective clustering algorithm
- [ ] Produces branch groupings with confidence scores
- [ ] Handles outliers and edge cases
- [ ] Validated against known groupings

---

## Test Strategy
