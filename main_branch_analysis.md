# Branch Analysis Report: main

## Overview
This report provides a detailed analysis of the main branch, which serves as the primary production branch for the Email Intelligence Platform.

## Branch Characteristics
- **Primary Focus**: Production stability and core features
- **Development Stage**: Stable, production-ready code
- **Integration Point**: All features must eventually integrate into main
- **Quality Standard**: Highest quality and testing requirements

## Key Components
