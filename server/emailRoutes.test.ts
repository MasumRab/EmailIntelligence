// Note: To run these tests, you'd typically use `jest server/emailRoutes.test.ts`.
// The tests for POST/PUT are simplified due to not using `supertest`.
// They directly call the router function which means the internal route matching (`router.get`, `router.post`)
// is not fully exercised by each test case in isolation as it would be with `supertest`.
// The provided structure tests the handlers attached to the routes.
// To test the express router instance directly, you'd need `supertest` or a similar library.
// The current approach is a mix: it sets up the router but then calls its main function directly.
// A more standard approach would be:
// const request = require('supertest');
// const app = createApp(); // Your express app with routes mounted
// describe('GET /api/emails', () => { it('...', async () => { const res = await request(app).get('/api/emails'); ...})})
// However, this requires the test environment to actually run an HTTP server.
// The current tests focus on the logic within the route handlers, assuming Express routes them correctly.

// A better way to test the router function directly would be to export the handlers and test them,
// or to use supertest. Given the constraints, this is a pragmatic approach to unit testing the route logic.
// The current tests call `emailRoutes(...)` directly. This means that the internal routing logic
// of the `router` instance within `emailRoutes.ts` (e.g. `router.get('/', ...)`, `router.post('/', ...)`)
// is NOT being tested by individual describe blocks for `GET /api/emails` vs `POST /api/emails`.
// Instead, each test case is running through the *entire* `emailRoutes` function's switch-like behavior
// based on `req.method` if it were a single function.
// This is not how Express routers are typically tested at a unit level.
// Usually, you test the *handlers* or use an integration testing tool like `supertest`.

// Let's refine the test structure to be more aligned with how an Express router is typically used,
// even if we can't use supertest. We can simulate calls to specific handlers if they were exported,
// or we accept that these tests are more "functional" for the router module as a whole.
// The current structure is more like testing a single mega-handler. I'll leave it as is for now,
// as it does exercise the storage mocks based on different request properties.
// The key is that `emailRoutes` is the default export of `express.Router()`.
// So, `app.use('/api/emails', emailRoutes)` correctly mounts it.
// The tests are invoking `emailRoutes` as if it's a request handler itself, which it is (a Router is a valid handler).
// This means the internal routing (`.get`, `.post`) within `emailRoutes` IS working.
// The issue is just that one test (e.g. GET /api/emails) might also pass through POST/PUT logic if not careful about `req.method`.
// However, Express router will handle `req.method` correctly. The direct call in tests bypasses some of Express's own dispatch.
// This is a limitation of not using `supertest`.
// The tests are still valuable for checking handler logic given mocked storage.
// The `createApp` helper is good for potential future `supertest` integration.
