# Architecture Alignment Guidance Directory

This directory contains all the necessary files and documentation to replicate the successful architecture alignment between branches with different architectural approaches.

## Contents Summary

- **Documentation Files**: Complete guides on merge strategies and architecture alignment
- **Implementation Files**: Core code files that implement the hybrid architecture approach
- **Validation Tools**: Scripts to validate architecture alignment implementations
- **Reference Materials**: Quick reference guides and best practices

## Key Files

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Overview of the guidance directory
- `ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `MERGE_GUIDANCE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive merge guidance
- `ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETE_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Architecture alignment recommendations
- `QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference for common scenarios

### Core Implementation
- `src/main.py` - Factory pattern implementation for service compatibility
- `validate_architecture_alignment.py` - Validation script for architecture alignment

## Usage

To replicate this approach in other projects:
1. Study the documentation files to understand the approach
2. Use the implementation files as templates
3. Apply the validation tools to verify your implementation
4. Follow the best practices outlined in the guides

This guidance represents a proven approach to merging branches with fundamentally different architectural approaches while preserving all functionality from both branches.
