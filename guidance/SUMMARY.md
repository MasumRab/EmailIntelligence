# EmailIntelligence Architecture Alignment & CLI Integration Guidance Directory

This directory contains all the necessary files and documentation to replicate the successful architecture alignment between branches with different architectural approaches and integrate advanced CLI features.

## Contents Summary

- **Documentation Files**: Complete guides on merge strategies, architecture alignment, and CLI integration
- **Implementation Files**: Core code files that implement the hybrid architecture approach
- **Validation Tools**: Scripts to validate architecture alignment implementations
- **Reference Materials**: Quick reference guides and best practices
- **CLI Integration Framework**: Modular framework for safe feature integration

## Key Files

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Overview of the guidance directory
- `COMPREHENSIVE_CLI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide covering CLI integration and architecture alignment
- `ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `MERGE_GUIDANCE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive merge guidance
- `ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_COMPLETE_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Architecture alignment recommendations
- `QUICK_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md` - Quick reference for common scenarios

### Core Implementation
- `src/main.py` - Factory pattern implementation for service compatibility
- `validate_architecture_alignment.py` - Validation script for architecture alignment

## Usage

To replicate this approach in other projects:
1. Start with `COMPREHENSIVE_CLI_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` for a complete overview
2. Study the documentation files to understand the approach
3. Use the implementation files as templates
4. Apply the validation tools to verify your implementation
5. Follow the best practices outlined in the guides
6. Use the CLI integration framework for advanced features

This guidance represents a proven approach to merging branches with fundamentally different architectural approaches while preserving all functionality from both branches and integrating advanced CLI features safely.
