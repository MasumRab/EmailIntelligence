### FR-009: Use GitHub CLI (gh) tool to inspect, review, and manage PR issues, comments, and merge conflicts
- [ ] GitHub CLI is properly integrated into the process
- [ ] All PR inspection tasks use GitHub CLI commands
- [ ] Commands are parameterized to work with arbitrary PR numbers
- [ ] Error handling for GitHub CLI operations is implemented

### FR-010: Use gh command line tool to retrieve PR details, comments, and status information
- [ ] System uses `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER]` for PR details
- [ ] System uses `gh pr comments [PR_NUMBER]` for comments
- [ ] System uses `gh pr diff [PR_NUMBER]` for changes
- [ ] All commands accept parameterized PR number

### FR-011: Use GitHub CLI (gh) tool to inspect potential conflicts or dependencies with PR #182 (branch pr-179)
- [ ] System can check for conflicts with other PRs

### FR-012: Use gh command line tool to inspect PR #182 for potential conflicts
- [ ] System can specifically target PR #182 for conflict checking
- [ ] Process includes steps to analyze cross-PR conflicts

### FR-013: Accept PR number as user input parameter
- [ ] System prompts user for PR number or accepts as argument
- [ ] Input validation is performed on the PR number
- [ ] All internal processes use the provided PR number
- [ ] Default PR number handling is replaced with user input

### FR-014: Parameterize all PR-specific values to accept user input for PR number
