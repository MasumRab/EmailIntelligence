**Updated:** January 6, 2026

## What's Here

Documents describing the old task-001 through task-020 numbering system that was used in early project planning. This numbering has been completely deprecated in favor of the current Phase 3 numbering (007, 075.1-5, 079-083).

## Documents in This Folder

- `TASK_NUMBERING_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Old implementation checklist
- `TASK_ID_MIGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Old migration guide
- `TASK_RETROFIT_PLAN.md` - Old retrofit approach
- `NEW_TASK_PLAN_EVALUATION_AND_PROCESSING_PLAN.md` - Old evaluation planning

## Important Notes

### ❌ DO NOT USE
- task-001.md through task-020.md file names
- References to "Task 001" through "Task 020"
- Old task structure format
- `new_task_plan/task_files/` with old numbering

### ✅ USE INSTEAD
- task_007.md (Branch Alignment Strategy)
- task_075.1-5.md (Alignment Analyzers)
- task_079-083.md (Frameworks and Testing)
- Current location: `/tasks/` directory

## Why Was This Archived?

The old numbering system (task-001 through task-020) represented an early planning view of the project. As the project evolved:

1. Focus narrowed to Phase 3 (Alignment Framework)
2. Planning tasks were consolidated with implementation work
3. New numbering system created to reflect current scope
4. Old documentation kept for historical reference
