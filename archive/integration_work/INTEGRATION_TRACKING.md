## Quick Commands for This Tracking

```bash
# Check progress on specific task
grep -A 2 "Status:" INTEGRATION_TRACKING.md | grep "75.X"

# See current line counts
wc -l task-75.*.md | sort -n

# Verify integration added content to all files
grep -c "From HANDOFF" task-75.*.md

# Check which tasks still need work
grep "Not Started" INTEGRATION_TRACKING.md
```
