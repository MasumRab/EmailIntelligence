## Task Master AI Commands Integrated

### Complexity Analysis
- task-master analyze-complexity --research --to=75.X
- task-master analyze-complexity --research --from=75.1 --to=75.9
- task-master complexity-report

### Task Expansion
- task-master expand --id=75.X --research --force --num=8
- task-master expand --all --research --force

### Research-Backed Enrichment
- task-master update-subtask --id=75.X.Y --prompt="[Context]"
- task-master update-subtask --id=75.X.Y --prompt="[Context]" --research

### Dependency Management
- task-master add-dependency --id=75.X --depends-on=75.Y
- task-master validate-dependencies

### Status & Progress Tracking
- task-master set-status --id=75.X.Y --status=done
- task-master show 75.X
- task-master list --status=pending
- task-master list --status=in-progress
- task-master next

## Validation Checkpoints Added

### Pre-Implementation Validation
✓ Dependency structure validation
✓ Effort estimates and success criteria verification
✓ Complexity analysis completion check
✓ Task queue ordering verification

### During Implementation Validation
✓ Subtask status tracking
✓ Dependency unblocking verification
✓ Progress monitoring
✓ Active work visibility

### Post-Task Validation
✓ All subtasks completion check
✓ Output file verification
✓ Integration requirement verification
✓ Complexity report generation

### Final System Validation
✓ All 9 main tasks completion check
✓ Blocking dependencies resolution
✓ Output specification matching (manual)
✓ Downstream compatibility verification
✓ Final report generation

## Workflow Timeline

### Week 1: Planning & Analysis
- Day 1: Initialize with task-master
- Day 2-3: Create main tasks
- Day 3-4: Run complexity analysis with research
- Day 5: Plan resource allocation based on reports

### Week 2: Expansion & Enrichment
- Daily: Expand one main task (75.1 through 75.9)
- Add enrichment context to all subtasks
- End of week: Validate all dependencies

### Weeks 3-8: Implementation
- Daily: Check next available task
- Weekly: Generate progress reports
- After each subtask: Validate and unblock next
- After each main task: Full validation checkpoint

### Week 9: Final Validation
- Verify all completion
- Validate no dependency issues
- Generate final metrics
- Archive results

## Next Actions

1. ✓ Read TASK_MASTER_AI_WORKFLOW.md to understand phases
2. ✓ Read TASK_BREAKDOWN_GUIDE.md for step-by-step setup
3. Create task-creation outlines for 75.2, 75.3, 75.5-75.9 (following pattern)
4. Run task-master init and create Task 75 main task
5. Execute Phase 1: Complexity analysis with research
6. Execute Phase 2: Expand all tasks with research
7. Execute Phase 3: Enrich subtasks with context
8. Execute Phase 4: Validation checkpoints
9. Assign to team and begin implementation
10. Track progress using task-master commands

## Key Integration Points

✓ Task creation uses task-master add-task
✓ Complexity analysis uses task-master analyze-complexity --research
✓ Task expansion uses task-master expand --research --force
✓ Enrichment uses task-master update-subtask with context
✓ Validation uses task-master validate-dependencies
✓ Progress tracking uses task-master list/show/next
✓ Reporting uses task-master complexity-report

All documents now include:
- Task Master AI commands where appropriate
- Validation checkpoints before phase transitions
- Research-backed insights
- Complexity analysis integration
- Progress tracking guidance
- Integration checkpoint validation
