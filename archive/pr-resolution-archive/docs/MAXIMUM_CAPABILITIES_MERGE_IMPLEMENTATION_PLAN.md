## Part I: Strategic Foundation

### Maximum Capabilities Framework

Our approach transforms traditional conflict resolution from **destructive elimination** to **constructive enhancement**:

```
Traditional Approach:  PR Conflicts → Code Elimination → Functionality Loss
Maximum Capabilities:  PR Conflicts → Intelligent Integration → Enhanced Capabilities
```

### Core Principles

1. **Functionality Preservation First**
   - All existing features must be preserved
   - Enhancement over elimination
   - Cross-branch capability integration

2. **Intelligent Conflict Resolution**
   - Three-way merge analysis
   - API compatibility maintenance
   - Configuration preservation
   - Documentation enhancement

3. **Branch Policy Compliance**
   - Respect orchestration-tools file ownership
   - Maintain main branch distribution integrity
   - Preserve scientific branch research isolation
   - Enforce propagation rule adherence

### Capability Enhancement Strategy

#### Functional Hierarchy
1. **Core Logic Preservation** (100% retention)
2. **API Compatibility Maintenance** (backward compatible)
3. **Configuration Enhancement** (additive improvements)
4. **Documentation Amplification** (expanded coverage)
5. **Infrastructure Optimization** (performance improvements)
