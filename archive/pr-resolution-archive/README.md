## Archiving Rationale
These files were moved to archive as part of project cleanup to:
1. Clear the active codebase of deprecated PR resolution efforts
2. Maintain historical reference of previous work
3. Preserve implementation details and lessons learned
4. Keep the project structure clean and focused

## Historical Context
The files in this archive represent comprehensive efforts to resolve 16 conflicting pull requests using an automated "maximum capabilities merge strategy." While these efforts were extensive, they were ultimately set aside in favor of alternative approaches.

## Preserved for Reference
This archive is maintained for:
- Historical analysis of PR resolution approaches
- Reference for similar future challenges
- Documentation of technical decisions and methodologies
- Lessons learned from the resolution process

## Current Status
As of November 11, 2025, these archived files are maintained for reference only. They are not actively developed or maintained.
