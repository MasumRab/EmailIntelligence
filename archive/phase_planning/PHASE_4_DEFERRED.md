# Phase 4 Deferred: Remaining Tasks Retrofit

**Decision Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Status:** Deferred  
**Reason:** Allow Phase 2-3 completion and Task 001 scope audit before committing

---

## Deferred Tasks

- Task 001 - Project Framework Setup
- Task 007 - Configuration Management
- Task 079 - Validation Framework
- Task 080 - Testing Infrastructure  
- Task 083 - Security Framework
- Task 100 - Documentation System
- Task 101 - Orchestration Tools Framework

**Total Effort If Retrofitted:** 200-300 hours (4-6 weeks)

---

## Deferral Rationale

### Critical Blocker: Task 001 Scope Unknown
- Appears to be 200+ criteria based on references
- Could be 1-2 weeks effort alone
- Necessary to audit before Phase 4 planning

### Recommended Workflow

**Weeks 1-8:**
- Phase 2 (Task 075 shallow): 1 week (parallel)
- Phase 3 Lightweight: 3-5 hours (this week)
- Task 002.1-5 Implementation: Primary focus (weeks 2-6)
- Phase 3 Full: weeks 6-8 (weeks 6-8)

**Week 8+:**
- Audit Task 001 scope (1-2 hours)
- Decide Phase 4 approach based on findings:
  - Small scope (<50 criteria) → Include in Phase 4
  - Medium scope (50-200 criteria) → Selective retrofit
  - Large scope (200+ criteria) → May warrant own phase

## Phase 4 Options When Ready

### Option A: Full Retrofit (4-6 weeks)
All 7 tasks converted to TASK_STRUCTURE_STANDARD.md template

**Pros:**
- Complete project standardization
- No scattered information
- Future-proof

**Cons:**
- High effort
- Requires understanding diverse domains

---

### Option B: Selective Retrofit (2-4 weeks)
3-4 highest-priority tasks only

**Pros:**
- Balanced effort/benefit
- Focuses on critical paths

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent standardization
- Defers cleanup debt

---

### Option C: Monitor and Adjust (defer indefinitely)
Standardize as-needed when touching tasks

**Pros:**
- No upfront commitment
- Flexible

**Cons:**
- Fragmentation risk
- Harder to maintain

## Task 001 Audit Plan

When Phase 3 complete, audit Task 001:

1. **Review current state** (20 minutes)
   - Read task_001.md or consolidated version
   - Estimate success criteria count
   - Identify sub-sections/modules

2. **Estimate effort** (30 minutes)
   - Map to TASK_STRUCTURE_STANDARD.md
   - Estimate hours to retrofit
   - Identify dependencies

3. **Decide Phase 4 approach** (30 minutes)
   - Share findings with team
   - Choose A/B/C option above
   - Create Phase 4 plan if proceeding

**Total Audit Time:** 1-2 hours

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 4 Decision

Phase 4 decision will be made when:
- [ ] Phase 2 complete (Task 075 retrofitted)
- [ ] Phase 3 complete (Task 002.6-9 full structure)
- [ ] Task 001 scope audited
- [ ] Team feedback on Phase 2-3 patterns incorporated

---

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 2-3** (weeks 1-8)
2. **Audit Task 001** (1-2 hours, week 8)
3. **Decide Phase 4** (30 minutes, week 8+)
4. **Plan Phase 4 execution** (if proceeding)

---

**Status:** Ready for Phase 2-3 execution  
**Blockers:** None  
**Owner:** Project Team  
**Next Review:** After Phase 3 completion
