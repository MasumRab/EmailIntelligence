# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the Orchestration Tools Verification and Review Constitution:
- Verification-First Development: All implementation must include comprehensive verification before merging to any target branch
- Goal-Task Consistency: All implementation tasks must align with defined project goals
- Role-Based Access Control: Implementation must support multiple permission levels (Read, Run, Review, Admin) with appropriate authentication for the deployment context
- Extensibility & Integration: Integration with existing CI/CD and Git version control systems with plugin architecture for new test scenarios
- Context-Aware Verification: Verification must include environment variables, dependency versions, configuration files, infrastructure state, cross-branch compatibility, and context contamination prevention
- Token Optimization and Resource Efficiency: System must monitor and optimize token usage to minimize computational overhead
- Fail-Safe by Default: Detailed diagnostic reports for failures but allow merges to proceed with appropriate warnings
- Security Requirements: Appropriate authentication method for deployment context with secure handling of sensitive data
- Observability: All verification results must be logged with structured logging, correlation IDs, and real-time monitoring
- Performance & Efficiency: Optimized execution with parallel processing and caching of expensive operations
- Reliability Requirements: 99.9% uptime with automatic retry mechanisms and graceful failure handling

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
