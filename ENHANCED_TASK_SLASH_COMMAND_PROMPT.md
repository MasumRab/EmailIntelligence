- Document inconsistencies and areas for improvement
- Assess the current state of task documentation

### 2. Improvement Areas to Address
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent formatting and structure across all files
- **Completeness**: Verify all necessary sections are present (description, steps, dependencies, success criteria)
- **Readability**: Improve clarity, formatting, and organization
- **Maintainability**: Add versioning, metadata, and update guidelines
- **Usability**: Enhance navigation, cross-references, and linking

### 3. Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing content
- Follow markdown best practices
- Ensure changes are implementable in a reasonable timeframe
- Preserve important historical information

## Deliverables

### 1. Current State Assessment
- Inventory of all task markdown files
- Summary of current structure and content
- List of identified issues and inconsistencies

### 2. Improvement Plan
- Prioritized list of improvements to implement
- Recommended standard format for task markdown files
- Implementation timeline and approach
- Resource requirements and dependencies

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Step-by-step instructions for applying improvements
- Templates or examples for new standard format
- Quality assurance checklist
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Output Format
Provide your analysis and plan in the following structured format:

### Current State Assessment
- File count and naming patterns
- Structure analysis
- Issues identified

### Recommended Improvements
- High priority (critical issues)
- Medium priority (important enhancements)
- Low priority (nice-to-have improvements)

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Critical fixes
- Phase 2: Structural improvements
- Phase 3: Enhancement and optimization

### Success Criteria
- How to measure improvement success
- Quality metrics to track
- Validation methods
```

## Evaluation Analysis

### 1. Clarity & Specificity
**Current State:**
- The prompt is clear and well-structured

- No significant ambiguity remains
- Well-defined objectives and deliverables

### 2. Structure & Organization
**Current State:**
- Excellent structure with clear headers and sections
- Logical flow from objective to requirements to deliverables
- Well-organized with numbered steps and bullet points

### 3. Context & Constraints
**Current State:**
- Good context provided about the task files
- Clear constraints and boundaries defined
- Assumptions are stated explicitly

### 4. Output Specification
**Current State:**
- Clear output format specified
- Structured sections defined
- Appropriate level of detail specified

# Task Markdown Files Improvement Plan with Slash Command Integration

## Objective
Analyze the existing markdown files in the ./tasks/ directory and create a comprehensive improvement plan that enhances their structure, content, and usability, while integrating slash commands to automate and streamline the improvement process.

## Context
The ./tasks/ directory contains markdown files that document various tasks. These files need to be improved to follow consistent standards, enhance readability, and provide better guidance for task implementation. Slash commands available in the environment should be leveraged to automate repetitive tasks and enhance the workflow.

## Requirements

### 1. Analysis Phase with Command Integration
- Use appropriate slash commands to inventory and analyze all markdown files in the ./tasks/ directory
- Identify current structure, formatting, and content patterns using automated tools
- Document inconsistencies and areas for improvement with command-assisted analysis
- Assess the current state of task documentation using available utilities

### 2. Improvement Areas to Address
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent formatting and structure across all files
- **Completeness**: Verify all necessary sections are present (description, steps, dependencies, success criteria)
- **Readability**: Improve clarity, formatting, and organization
- **Maintainability**: Add versioning, metadata, and update guidelines
- **Usability**: Enhance navigation, cross-references, and linking
- **Automation**: Integrate slash commands to streamline repetitive improvement tasks

### 3. Slash Command Integration Requirements
- Identify which slash commands can be used to automate file analysis
- Determine commands that can assist with standardization tasks
- Evaluate commands that can help with content validation
- Assess opportunities for command chaining to improve workflow efficiency

### 4. Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing content
- Follow markdown best practices
- Ensure slash command integrations are practical and useful
- Preserve important historical information
- Consider security and access controls for command usage

## Deliverables

### 1. Current State Assessment
- Automated inventory of all task markdown files using slash commands
- Summary of current structure and content with command-assisted analysis
- List of identified issues and inconsistencies with severity ratings
- Available slash commands inventory and their potential applications

### 2. Improvement Plan
- Prioritized list of improvements to implement with automation opportunities highlighted
- Recommended standard format for task markdown files
- Integration plan for slash command usage in the improvement workflow
- Implementation timeline and approach with command-assisted phases
- Resource requirements and dependencies

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Step-by-step instructions for applying improvements with command integration
- Templates or examples for new standard format
- Guidelines for using slash commands with task files
- Quality assurance checklist with command-assisted validation
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Output Format
Provide your analysis and plan in the following structured format:

### Current State Assessment
- File count and naming patterns (generated with slash commands)
- Structure analysis (with command-assisted pattern recognition)
- Issues identified (with severity ratings)
- Available slash commands inventory and their potential applications

### Slash Command Integration Opportunities
- Commands that can automate file analysis
- Commands that can assist with standardization
- Commands that can help with content validation
- Commands that can improve workflow efficiency
- Security considerations for each integration

### Recommended Improvements
- High priority (critical issues) with automation potential
- Medium priority (important enhancements) with automation potential
- Low priority (nice-to-have improvements) with automation potential

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Critical fixes with command automation
- Phase 2: Structural improvements with command assistance
