# Documented Development Sessions Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the framework for documented development sessions within the EmailIntelligence project, integrating with the iFlow CLI and following the guidelines in IFLOW.md.

## Session Structure

Each development session follows a consistent structure to ensure proper documentation and tracking:

### 1. Session Initialization
- Create a new session log in `backlog/sessions/` with the naming convention `IFLOW-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md`
- Document session goals, context, and initial state
- Update the main `SESSION_LOG.md` with session tracking information

### 2. Task Planning
- Use the iFlow CLI todo system to track tasks
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Prioritize tasks based on project needs

### 3. Implementation
- Follow project conventions as documented in IFLOW.md
- Use appropriate tools for code reading, writing, and modification
- Maintain consistent code style with existing project code

### 4. Documentation
- Document all activities in the session log
- Update relevant documentation files as needed
- Record development priorities and next steps

### 5. Session Closure
- Summarize completed work and outcomes
- Document any remaining tasks for future sessions
- Archive session log appropriately

## Session Goals and Expectations

### Primary Goals
1. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent documentation practices across all development sessions
2. **Traceability**: Ensure all development activities can be traced and understood
3. **Collaboration**: Facilitate effective collaboration through clear documentation
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Preserve knowledge for future development efforts

### Quality Standards
1. **Completeness**: All significant activities should be documented
2. **Accuracy**: Documentation should accurately reflect actual work performed
3. **Clarity**: Documentation should be clear and easily understandable
4. **Timeliness**: Documentation should be updated regularly during development

## Integration with IFLOW.md

### Core Mandates Alignment
1. **Conventions**: All session documentation follows established project conventions
2. **Libraries/Frameworks**: Documentation references verified libraries and frameworks only
3. **Style & Structure**: Documentation maintains consistent style with project standards
4. **Idiomatic Changes**: All documentation changes integrate naturally with existing documentation

### Tools Utilization
- `read_file`: For reviewing existing documentation
- `write_file`: For creating new documentation
- `replace`: For updating existing documentation
- `search_file_content`: For finding relevant documentation sections
- `glob`: For identifying documentation files
- `run_shell_command`: For executing documentation-related commands
- `todo_write`/`todo_read`: For tracking documentation tasks

## Workflow Process for Sessions

### 1. Understand
- Analyze the development task or goal
- Review relevant project documentation and codebase context
- Identify documentation requirements

### 2. Plan
- Build a coherent plan for documentation needs
- Identify which documents need to be created or updated
- Plan documentation review process

### 3. Implement
- Create or update documentation as needed
- Use appropriate tools to maintain documentation quality
- Follow project documentation conventions

### 4. Verify
- Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
- Ensure documentation aligns with code changes
- Verify integration with existing documentation

### 5. Maintain
- Update documentation as development progresses
- Archive session logs appropriately
- Ensure documentation remains current

## Session Tracking and Management

### File Organization
- Main session log: `SESSION_LOG.md`
- Individual session logs: `backlog/sessions/IFLOW-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md`
- Implementation plans: `implement/plan.md`
- Implementation state: `implement/state.json`

### Naming Conventions
- Session logs: `IFLOW-YYYYMMDD-XXX.md`
- Implementation plans: `plan.md`
- State tracking: `state.json`

### Status Tracking
- Use the iFlow CLI todo system for task tracking
- Update session logs regularly during development
- Maintain implementation state in JSON format

## Best Practices

### Documentation Practices
1. **Regular Updates**: Update documentation frequently during development
2. **Clear Language**: Use clear, concise language in documentation
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent formatting with existing documentation
4. **Relevant Information**: Include only relevant information in documentation

### Collaboration Practices
1. **Shared Understanding**: Ensure documentation creates shared understanding
2. **Accessibility**: Make documentation easily accessible to team members
3. **Review Process**: Include documentation in code review process
4. **Feedback Loop**: Establish feedback mechanisms for documentation quality

### Quality Assurance
1. **Accuracy**: Verify documentation accuracy against actual implementation
2. **Completeness**: Ensure documentation covers all relevant aspects
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency with project standards
4. **Timeliness**: Keep documentation current with development progress

## Conclusion

This framework provides a structured approach to documented development sessions that integrates with the iFlow CLI and follows project conventions. By following this framework, development activities will be properly documented, tracked, and integrated with the overall project documentation.
