- **WorkflowManager**: Storage and retrieval of node-based workflows

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Modular Architecture
The system follows a modular design where core functionality is separated into distinct modules:
- Core components in `src/core/`
- Feature modules in `modules/`
- Backend services in `backend/`
- Frontend components in `client/src/`

### 2. Node-Based Processing
Inspired by ComfyUI, automatic1111, and Stability-AI frameworks:
- Visual workflow creation with drag-and-drop interface
- Composable processing pipelines
- Extensible node system with plugin support
- Dependency management between nodes

### 3. Microservices Architecture
- Polyglot approach with Python (FastAPI) and Node.js backends
- Independent deployment of services
- Clear separation of concerns
- API-first design for inter-service communication

### 4. Event-Driven Processing
- Asynchronous processing with async/await patterns
- Background task execution for long-running operations
- Real-time updates through reactive frontend components

## Data Flow Architecture

```
Email Input → Preprocessing → AI Analysis → Categorization → Storage → UI
     ↓            ↓             ↓              ↓            ↓      ↓
  Raw Emails   Clean Data   Sentiment,      Categories   JSON    Dashboard
                            Topic, Intent,               Files
                            Urgency
```

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Email Ingestion**: Emails are received from various sources (Gmail, files, API)
2. **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, normalization, and tokenization
3. **AI Analysis**: Multi-model analysis for sentiment, topic, intent, and urgency
4. **Categorization**: Smart categorization with confidence scoring
5. **Storage**: Efficient storage with caching and indexing
6. **Presentation**: Data visualization and user interaction

## Security Architecture
