# BRANCH OWNERSHIP GUIDE

**PLACEHOLDER - BRANCH SPECIFIC CONTENT**

This documentation exists on the `scientific` branch but not on `main`.

## Pseudocode for Branch-Specific Generation

```pseudocode
IF branch == "scientific":
    INCLUDE: Scientific/research-focused content for BRANCH_OWNERSHIP_GUIDE
    INCLUDE: Experimental features and methodologies
    INCLUDE: Advanced technical implementations
ELSE IF branch == "main":
    INCLUDE: Production-ready content for BRANCH_OWNERSHIP_GUIDE
    INCLUDE: Stable implementations and best practices
    INCLUDE: User-facing documentation and guides
```

## TODO: Generate Branch-Specific Content

When implementing this documentation for the `main` branch:

1. Adapt content for production use cases
2. Include stable implementation details
3. Add user-friendly explanations
4. Document best practices and guidelines
5. Include troubleshooting and common issues

*This placeholder will be replaced with actual content when branch-specific documentation is generated.*
