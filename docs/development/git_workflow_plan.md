# Git Workflow Plan: Managing Documentation Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended approach for managing the documentation changes created during our analysis of the node-based workflow system. The changes include three new documentation files:
1. `docs/workflow_system_analysis.md` - Comprehensive analysis of the current workflow system
2. `docs/project_structure_comparison.md` - Text-based diagram comparing old and new project structures
3. `docs/workflow_implementation_plan.md` - Phased implementation plan for future development

## Current State Assessment
- The documentation changes are already created in the local filesystem
- No git operations have been performed yet
- Need to determine the appropriate branch for these changes

## Recommended Git Workflow

### 1. Initial Repository Assessment
```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Check status of repository
git status

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git diff
```

### 2. Strategy Selection Based on Repository State

#### If on Main Branch
```bash
# Create a new feature branch for the documentation changes
git checkout -b feature/workflow-documentation-analysis

# Add and commit the new documentation files
git add docs/workflow_system_analysis.md docs/project_structure_comparison.md docs/workflow_implementation_plan.md
git commit -m "Add workflow system analysis, structure comparison, and implementation plan"

# Push the new branch
git push -u origin feature/workflow-documentation-analysis

# Then create a pull request to merge into main
```

#### If on a Development/Feature Branch
```bash
# Add and commit the new documentation files
git add docs/workflow_system_analysis.md docs/project_structure_comparison.md docs/workflow_implementation_plan.md
git commit -m "Add workflow system analysis, structure comparison, and implementation plan"

# If the current branch is meant to be merged to main, proceed with your normal workflow
# If this branch is not meant for main, identify the appropriate target branch
```

### 3. Working with Unmerged Branches
If there are other unmerged branches that might benefit from these documentation changes:

#### For Related Feature Branches
- Consider if the documentation changes should be applied to those branches
- Use cherry-pick to apply the specific commits:
```bash
git checkout <target-branch>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-of-documentation-changes>
```

#### For Stale Branches
- If there are old branches that might contain conflicting documentation:
```bash
# Check what's in other branches
git checkout <other-branch>
git status
git log --oneline -10

# If the branch needs the new documentation:
git merge main  # or rebase
```

## Plan for Integrating New Design Changes or Features

### 1. For Pulling Changes from Main to Feature Branches
```bash
# While on your feature branch
git checkout <feature-branch>
git pull origin main
# Or alternatively
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

### 2. For Merging Feature Branches to Main
```bash
# Ensure your branch is up to date
git checkout <feature-branch>
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # or git merge origin/main

# Run tests to ensure no conflicts
# Make any necessary adjustments

# Push and create pull request
git push origin <feature-branch>
```

### 3. For Cherry-Picking Specific Commits
If only specific documentation changes are needed in other branches:
```bash
# Get the commit hash
git log --oneline -5

# Cherry-pick the specific commit to another branch
git checkout <target-branch>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

## Recommended Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy
- Keep documentation changes in a separate branch from code feature changes where possible
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/workflow-documentation-analysis`
- Regularly sync with main branch to avoid conflicts

### 2. Commit Strategy
- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- Group related changes together
- Use present tense in commit messages: "Add workflow analysis" not "Added workflow analysis"

### 3. Merge Strategies
- Use rebase when possible to maintain a clean history
- Use merge commit when you want to preserve the branch structure
- Consider squash and merge for feature branches to keep main clean

### 4. Conflict Resolution
When conflicts occur during merge/rebase:
1. Address conflicts thoughtfully, especially in documentation files
2. Verify that merged documentation makes sense in the target context
3. Update any cross-references that might be affected

## Specific Workflow for This Documentation Set

### Step 1: Create Documentation Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/workflow-documentation-update
git add docs/workflow_system_analysis.md docs/project_structure_comparison.md docs/workflow_implementation_plan.md
git commit -m "Add comprehensive workflow system documentation based on analysis"
```

### Step 2: Push and Create PR
```bash
git push -u origin feature/workflow-documentation-update
```

### Step 3: Review and Merge
- Submit a pull request to the main branch
- Review the changes to ensure they align with the project's documentation standards
- Request review from team members if appropriate

### Step 4: Integration with Other Work
- After merging to main, update any long-running feature branches with the new documentation
- Consider if the analysis and plan should influence current development work
- Communicate the availability of the new documentation to the team

## Handling Future Design Changes

### For New Features
1. Document the new design before or during implementation
2. Add to the appropriate documentation files
3. Update the implementation plan as needed

### For Design Changes
1. Update the analysis document if fundamental assumptions change
2. Revise the project structure comparison if architecture changes significantly
3. Adjust the implementation plan phases as needed

## Quality Assurance Steps
Before merging documentation changes:
1. Verify that all documentation links are valid
2. Ensure the documentation is consistent with the current implementation
3. Review for clarity and completeness
4. Check that the documentation follows project style guidelines
