# ADR 003: Security Framework Implementation

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Email processing involves sensitive user data including personal communications, authentication credentials, and potentially confidential business information. A comprehensive security framework was essential to protect data integrity and user privacy.

## Decision
Implement a multi-layered security framework with path validation, data sanitization, access control, and audit logging.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Data Protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data
- **Path Security**: Blocks directory traversal attacks on file operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of security-relevant events
- **Compliance**: Supports regulatory requirements for data handling

### Negative
- **Performance Impact**: Security checks add processing overhead
- **Complexity**: Additional code complexity and maintenance
- **User Experience**: Stricter validation may require user adaptation

### Risks
- **False Positives**: Overly strict validation may block legitimate operations
- **Performance Degradation**: Security checks may impact throughput
- **Maintenance Burden**: Security code requires careful updates

## Implementation Details

### Security Layers
1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
2. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and resource authorization
3. **Data Sanitization**: Remove sensitive data from outputs
4. **Path Security**: Prevent directory traversal attacks
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging

### Key Components
- **PathValidator**: Secure file path validation and sanitization
- **SecurityContext**: Holds user permissions and session data
- **DataSanitizer**: Cleans sensitive data from outputs
- **AuditLogger**: Logs security events for compliance

### Security Levels
- **PUBLIC**: No authentication required
- **INTERNAL**: Basic authentication
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Elevated permissions required
- **RESTRICTED**: Administrative access only

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: External Security Service
- **Pros**: Specialized security expertise, centralized management
- **Cons**: Vendor dependency, integration complexity, cost

### Option 2: Minimal Security
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, fast development
- **Cons**: High security risk, compliance issues

### Option 3: Framework Security Only
- **Pros**: Leverage existing framework security
- **Cons**: Limited customization, may not meet specific requirements
