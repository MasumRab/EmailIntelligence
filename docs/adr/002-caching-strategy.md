# ADR 002: Distributed Caching Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The EmailIntelligence platform processes large volumes of email data and performs complex AI analysis. Without caching, repeated requests for similar data would cause significant performance degradation and increased computational costs.

## Decision
Implement a multi-level caching strategy with Redis support for distributed deployments, falling back to in-memory caching for single-instance setups.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Significant reduction in response times for repeated queries
- **Scalability**: Redis enables caching across multiple instances
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced AI model inference calls
- **User Experience**: Faster UI interactions and data loading

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure requirements
- **Memory Usage**: Cache storage consumes memory
- **Cache Invalidation**: Complex to ensure data consistency
- **Operational Overhead**: Redis management and monitoring

### Risks
- **Cache Staleness**: Outdated data serving incorrect results
- **Memory Pressure**: Large datasets may exhaust cache memory
- **Network Latency**: Redis calls add network overhead in distributed setups

## Implementation Details

### Cache Layers
1. **Application Cache**: Request-level caching in application memory
2. **Distributed Cache**: Redis for cross-instance data sharing
3. **Database Cache**: Query result caching at database level

### Cache Strategies
- **TTL-based Expiration**: Time-based cache invalidation
- **Tag-based Invalidation**: Invalidate related cache entries
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used eviction policy
- **Write-through**: Update cache on data modifications

### Cache Keys
- `emails:limit={limit}:offset={offset}:category={id}:unread={bool}`
- `categories_with_counts`
- `user:{id}:preferences`

### Monitoring
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Memory usage statistics
- Eviction rates
- Performance impact metrics

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Database-only Caching
- **Pros**: Simple, no additional infrastructure
- **Cons**: Poor performance, database load

### Option 2: CDN Caching
- **Pros**: Global distribution
- **Cons**: Not suitable for dynamic data, complex setup

### Option 3: Application-only Caching
- **Pros**: Simple implementation
- **Cons**: Not scalable across instances
