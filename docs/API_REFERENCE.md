# API Reference

**PLACEHOLDER - BRANCH SPECIFIC CONTENT**

This documentation exists on the `scientific` branch but not on `main`.

## Pseudocode for Branch-Specific Generation

```pseudocode
IF branch == "scientific":
    INCLUDE: Research API endpoints
    INCLUDE: Experimental API features
    INCLUDE: Development/testing APIs
    INCLUDE: Advanced integration options
ELSE IF branch == "main":
    INCLUDE: Production API endpoints
    INCLUDE: Stable API documentation
    INCLUDE: Client integration guides
    INCLUDE: API versioning and deprecation policies
```

## TODO: Generate Branch-Specific Content

When implementing this documentation for the `main` branch:

1. Document all production API endpoints
2. Include request/response examples
3. Add authentication and authorization details
4. Document rate limiting and error handling
5. Include SDK/client library information

*This placeholder will be replaced with actual content when branch-specific documentation is generated.*
