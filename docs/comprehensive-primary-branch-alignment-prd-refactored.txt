# Feature Branch Alignment with Primary Branches - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Systematically align multiple feature branches with their primary integration targets (main, scientific, or orchestration-tools) based on project needs and user choices. This involves determining the optimal target based on common history and codebase similarity, with main, scientific, and orchestration-tools remaining as primary branches. This alignment process will ensure code consistency, reduce future merge conflicts, and propagate the latest changes while allowing for flexible development approaches and targeted changes when necessary. Includes documentation processes to summarize changes and features, systematic checking for merge artifacts, garbled text, missing imports, and accidentally deleted modules, and implementation of efficient merge validation frameworks. Designed for a single advanced developer with minimum resources.
