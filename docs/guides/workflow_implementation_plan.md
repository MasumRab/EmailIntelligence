# Phased Implementation Plan: Node-Based Workflow System

## Summary of Current State

This document outlines a phased implementation plan for the node-based workflow system in the Email Intelligence Platform, based on the analysis documented in our chat. The system has already been largely implemented with core functionality, security features, and a comprehensive testing framework, but some advanced features remain to be completed.

### Key Findings from Analysis:
1. Core architecture is well-implemented with BaseNode, Workflow, Connection, and WorkflowRunner classes
2. Security framework includes input sanitization, execution sandboxing, and audit logging
3. All primary node types (EmailSourceNode, PreprocessingNode, AIAnalysisNode, FilterNode, ActionNode) are implemented
4. Complete REST API for workflow management is available
5. Gradio-based UI provides workflow editing capabilities
6. Comprehensive test suite covers nodes, security, and integration scenarios
7. Some advanced features like distributed processing and workflow sharing are still pending

## Project Guidelines & Design Goals

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Implement Google-style docstrings for all public functions/classes
- Apply error handling with specific exceptions and meaningful error messages
- Run linting tools: black, flake8, isort, pylint, mypy

### Security Practices
- Validate all inputs before processing
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure data transmission with signed tokens
- Regular security audits of new features
- Audit logging of all operations

### Testing Requirements
