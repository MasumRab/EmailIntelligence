# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support for the Email Intelligence Platform. The implementation includes TOTP-based authentication using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy, with backup codes for recovery.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Dependency Updates
- Added `pyotp>=2.9.0` for TOTP generation and verification
- Added `qrcode>=7.4.2` for generating QR codes for authenticator app setup

### 2. Database Updates
- Extended the User model in `src/core/database.py` to include MFA fields:
  - `mfa_enabled`: Boolean flag indicating if MFA is enabled
  - `mfa_secret`: TOTP secret for generating codes
  - `mfa_backup_codes`: List of backup codes for recovery

### 3. MFA Service
- Created `src/core/mfa.py` with `MFAService` class providing:
  - TOTP secret generation
  - QR code generation for authenticator app setup
  - Token verification
  - Backup code generation and verification

### 4. Authentication Routes
- Updated `modules/auth/routes.py` with new endpoints:
  - `/api/auth/mfa/setup` - Generate MFA setup information (secret, QR code, backup codes)
  - `/api/auth/mfa/enable` - Enable MFA after user verification
  - `/api/auth/mfa/disable` - Disable MFA for a user
- Enhanced login endpoint to require MFA token when MFA is enabled
- Support for both TOTP and backup code verification during login

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Authentication Hook
- Created `client/src/hooks/use-auth.ts` for managing authentication state and API calls

### 2. UI Components
- Created `client/src/components/auth/login-form.tsx` for login with MFA support
- Created `client/src/components/auth/mfa-setup.tsx` for MFA setup flow
- Created `client/src/components/auth/mfa-disable.tsx` for disabling MFA
- Created `client/src/components/auth/user-profile.tsx` for user profile management

### 3. Pages
- Created `client/src/pages/login.tsx` for the login page
- Created `client/src/pages/profile.tsx` for the user profile page

### 4. Routing
- Created `client/src/App.tsx` to set up client-side routing
- Updated sidebar to include a link to the profile page

## Security Features

### 1. TOTP Authentication
- Time-based one-time passwords generated using RFC 6238 standard
- QR code setup for easy authenticator app configuration
- Verification with 1-window drift tolerance for clock synchronization

### 2. Backup Codes
- 10 backup codes generated during MFA setup
- Each backup code can only be used once
- Backup codes are removed from the user's record after use

### 3. Token Handling
- MFA tokens are required during login when MFA is enabled
- Proper error handling for invalid tokens
- Secure storage of TOTP secrets and backup codes

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with username/password and optional MFA token
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user with MFA fields

### MFA Management
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/setup` - Setup MFA for current user
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/enable` - Enable MFA after verification
- `POST /api/auth/mfa/disable` - Disable MFA for current user

## Usage Flow

### Enabling MFA
1. User navigates to profile page
2. User clicks "Enable MFA" button
3. System generates secret, QR code, and backup codes
4. User scans QR code with authenticator app
5. User enters code from authenticator app to verify
6. MFA is enabled for the user

### Login with MFA
1. User enters username and password
2. System checks if MFA is enabled for user
3. If enabled, system prompts for MFA token
4. User enters token from authenticator app or backup code
5. System verifies token and grants access

### Disabling MFA
1. User navigates to profile page
2. User clicks "Disable MFA" button
3. System disables MFA for the user

## Future Improvements

1. SMS-based MFA as an alternative to authenticator apps
2. Email-based backup codes for additional recovery options
3. Device trust management for remembering trusted devices
4. Rate limiting for MFA attempts to prevent brute force attacks
5. Push notification-based MFA for improved user experience
