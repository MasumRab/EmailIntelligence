# AI Model Training Guide

**PLACEHOLDER - BRANCH SPECIFIC CONTENT**

This documentation exists on the `scientific` branch but not on `main`.

## Pseudocode for Branch-Specific Generation

```pseudocode
IF branch == "scientific":
    INCLUDE: Scientific AI model training procedures
    INCLUDE: Advanced ML pipeline documentation
    INCLUDE: Research-focused training methodologies
    INCLUDE: Experimental model architectures
ELSE IF branch == "main":
    INCLUDE: Production AI model training
    INCLUDE: Stable model deployment procedures
    INCLUDE: Production-ready training pipelines
    INCLUDE: Model validation and monitoring
```

## TODO: Generate Branch-Specific Content

When implementing this documentation for the `main` branch:

1. Focus on production-ready AI model training procedures
2. Include deployment and monitoring best practices
3. Document stable model architectures for production use
4. Add performance optimization guidelines
5. Include rollback and recovery procedures

*This placeholder will be replaced with actual content when branch-specific documentation is generated.*
