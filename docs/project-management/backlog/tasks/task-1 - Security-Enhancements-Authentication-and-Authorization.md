# Task: Security Enhancements - Authentication and Authorization

## Priority
HIGH

## Description
Implement enhanced security features for authentication and authorization based on the actionable insights document.

## Current Implementation
JWT-based authentication with basic authorization.

## Requirements
1. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
2. Add multi-factor authentication support
3. Implement session management with automatic expiration
4. Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 Implement role-based access control system
- [ ] #2 Add multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] #3 Implement session management with automatic expiration
- [ ] #4 Add audit logging for security-sensitive operations
<!-- AC:END -->

## Estimated Effort
