## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Update the alignment strategy based on analysis of both branches. The scientific branch already contains most architectural improvements from the backup-branch but with additional enhancements. Instead of cherry-picking from backup-branch, we need to identify what the backup-branch might be missing compared to the scientific branch and plan the proper merge approach.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Document which features are present in scientific but not in backup-branch
- [ ] #2 Identify what improvements from backup-branch are already implemented in scientific
- [ ] #3 Plan the proper merge direction (likely scientific -> backup-branch)
- [ ] #4 Update the alignment tasks accordingly
- [ ] #5 Document the recommended approach for final merge
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
After analyzing both branches, it appears that the scientific branch has evolved significantly and already incorporates most of the architectural improvements from the backup-branch (repository pattern, factory implementations, etc.) but with additional enhancements like schema versioning, security validation, and backup functionality. The recommended approach is likely to merge from scientific to backup-branch to ensure the backup-branch is up-to-date before the final merge.
