## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Analyze and document architectural improvements in the feature branch that should be adopted by the scientific branch, including efficient aggregation patterns, modular design, and performance optimizations.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Analyze DataSource interface improvements and aggregation methods
- [x] #2 Document modular dashboard architecture benefits
- [x] #3 Identify performance optimizations to port to scientific
- [x] #4 Create migration plan for architectural improvements
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Completed comprehensive analysis of architectural improvements. Key improvements identified: 1) Efficient server-side aggregation via get_dashboard_aggregates() method, 2) Modular dashboard architecture with clean separation, 3) Comprehensive DashboardStats model with all metrics, 4) Better error handling and performance monitoring, 5) Type-safe interfaces with Pydantic models. Migration plan: Phase 1 consolidation tasks will incrementally bring these improvements to scientific branch.
