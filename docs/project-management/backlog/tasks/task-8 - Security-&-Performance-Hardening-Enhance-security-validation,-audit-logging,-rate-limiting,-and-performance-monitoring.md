## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented comprehensive enterprise-grade security and performance hardening across the Email Intelligence Platform:

**üîí API Rate Limiting (`src/core/rate_limiter.py`):**
- Token bucket algorithm with configurable rates per endpoint
- Pre-configured limits: 120/min for emails, 30/min for workflows, 20/min for models
- Automatic rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-*) in responses
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent requests

**üìä Advanced Audit Logging (`src/core/audit_logger.py`):**
- Structured JSON logging with 15+ event types (auth, data ops, workflow, security)
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking main threads
- Severity levels (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) with automatic classification
- Comprehensive event metadata (user, session, IP, user-agent, resource, action)
- Workflow-specific and API access logging
- Background thread processing with graceful shutdown

**üõ°Ô∏è Security Validation (`src/core/security_validator.py`):**
- Node code validation with dangerous pattern detection (eval, exec, os imports, etc.)
- Security level-based module restrictions (untrusted/limited/trusted/system)
- Workflow execution validation with cycle detection and resource limits
- Node configuration validation with path traversal protection
- Integration with audit logging for security violations

**‚ö° Optimized Performance Monitoring (`src/core/performance_monitor.py`):**
- Configurable sampling rates to minimize overhead (default 10% for API requests)
- Asynchronous background processing and aggregation
- Sliding window statistics (avg, min, max, p95, p99)
- Memory-efficient storage with automatic cleanup
- Context manager and decorator support for easy integration
- Thread-safe metric collection

**üåê FastAPI Security Middleware (`src/core/middleware.py`):**
- Integrated rate limiting, audit logging, and performance monitoring
- Security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection, etc.)
- Real client IP detection through proxy headers
- Trusted proxy support for accurate IP logging
- Automatic audit trail generation for all API requests
- Performance timing for all endpoints with configurable sampling

**Key Security Features:**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers (input validation, rate limiting, audit trails)
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Every request validated and logged
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead through sampling and async processing
- **Enterprise Ready**: Structured logging, security headers, comprehensive audit trails
- **Configurable**: All components support different security/performance levels

All components are designed for production deployment with monitoring, alerting, and compliance capabilities.
