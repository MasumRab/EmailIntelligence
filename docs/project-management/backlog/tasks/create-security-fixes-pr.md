# Backlog Task: Create PR for Security Fixes Extraction

## Task ID: task-create-security-pr-1

## Priority: High

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that extracts critical security fixes from the large branches, specifically focusing on path traversal protections and input validation improvements. This PR should address security vulnerabilities without including unrelated changes.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `fix-critical-issues` and `fix/sqlite-paths`
- Create new branch: `security/path-traversal-fixes`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Path traversal protection mechanisms
2. Input validation for file paths and user inputs
3. SQLite database path validation
4. Secure handling of file system operations

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `fix-critical-issues` branch for security-related commits
2. Review `fix/sqlite-paths` branch for path validation fixes
3. Check if these fixes already exist in scientific branch
4. Document specific vulnerabilities being addressed

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `security/path-traversal-fixes` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the security fixes
3. Ensure changes are minimal and focused
4. Add comprehensive tests for the security fixes

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the vulnerabilities
2. Document how the fixes address each vulnerability
3. Include testing instructions for reviewers
4. Add security impact assessment

### Part 4: Testing
1. Run security-focused tests
2. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. Test edge cases for path traversal attempts
4. Ensure performance is not negatively impacted

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Security fixes are extracted into focused PR
- [ ] PR addresses only security-related changes
- [ ] All security tests pass
- [ ] PR description is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] GitHub PR is created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- Current PRs (docs cleanup, search in category) should be merged first
- Clean scientific branch as baseline

## Estimated Effort
1 day: Analysis and identification
1-2 days: Implementation and testing
0.5 day: Documentation and PR creation

## Notes
- Focus only on security fixes, avoid unrelated changes
- Each fix should be minimal and well-tested
- Coordinate with security team if available
- Run security scanning tools on changes
- Prioritize fixes that address known vulnerabilities
- Ensure backwards compatibility where possible
