# Backlog Task: Align Large Branches That Need Careful Review

## Task ID: task-align-large-branches-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
This task involves systematically breaking down and aligning large branches that contain important changes but are too large for efficient review. The goal is to extract focused changes from these branches and create smaller, manageable PRs.

## Branches Requiring Alignment

### 1. fix-critical-issues
- Current size: Very large diff
- Strategy needed: Extract just the critical security fixes
- Priority: High (security-related)

### 2. fix/sqlite-paths
- Current size: Very large diff
- Strategy needed: Extract just the SQLite path validation/security fixes
- Priority: High (security-related)

### 3. fix/launch-bat-issues
- Current size: Very large diff
- Strategy needed: Extract just the launch script fixes
- Priority: Medium

### 4. fix/import-errors-and-docs
- Current size: Very large diff
- Strategy needed: Separate import fixes from documentation changes
- Priority: Medium

### 5. fix/incorrect-await-usage
- Current size: Large diff
- Strategy needed: Extract just the async/await fixes
- Priority: Medium

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Assessment and Verification
1. Check if each branch's functionality already exists in scientific branch
2. Identify which changes are still relevant
3. Document what's already implemented vs. what's missing

### Part 2: Break Down Large Branches
1. Create new branches from current scientific for each feature/fix
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the necessary changes
3. Focus on one type of change per branch

### Part 3: Create Focused PRs
1. Submit each extracted change as a separate PR
2. Ensure each PR has clear documentation
3. Add or update tests for each change

### Part 4: Verification
1. Test each PR thoroughly
2. Ensure no regressions are introduced
3. Validate functionality works as expected

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All large branches are broken down into smaller PRs
- [ ] Each PR addresses only one specific issue/feature
- [ ] All PRs pass tests and review successfully
- [ ] No functionality is lost in the process

## Dependencies
- Current PRs (docs cleanup, search in category) should be merged first
- Clean scientific branch as baseline

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days: Assessment and breaking down branches
3-5 days: Creating individual PRs
1-2 days: Review and merge process

## Notes
- Security fixes should be prioritized
- Each PR should be as small and focused as possible
- Existing functionality should not be duplicated
- All changes should be thoroughly tested
- Always check if functionality already exists in scientific branch before extracting changes
- Use incremental integration - stage merges rather than trying to merge everything at once
- Focus on one type of change per branch (security, documentation, bug fixes, etc.)
