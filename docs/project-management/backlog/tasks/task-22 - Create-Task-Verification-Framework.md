## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a systematic framework for verifying that completed backlog tasks meet their acceptance criteria through code inspection, testing, and documentation checks.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Design verification checklist template for different task types
- [x] #2 Create verification script to automate checks where possible
- [x] #3 Implement manual verification process for complex tasks
- [x] #4 Apply framework to verify all currently completed tasks
- [x] #5 Document verification results and any gaps found
- [x] #6 Update task completion process to include verification step
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Analyze different types of tasks (security, feature, documentation, refactoring)
2. Create verification checklist templates for each type
3. Develop automated verification script for code/tests existence
4. Implement manual verification workflow
5. Apply to all completed tasks and document findings
6. Integrate verification into task completion process
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Created comprehensive task verification framework with automated and manual verification capabilities:

**Verification Script (`scripts/verify_tasks.py`):**
- Automated parsing of task files and acceptance criteria
- Code existence checks for implemented features
- Test coverage validation
- Documentation update verification
- Issue detection and reporting

**Verification Checklist Template:**
- Security tasks: Code security, tests, audit logs, validation
- Feature tasks: Implementation completeness, integration, testing
- Documentation tasks: Coverage, accuracy, accessibility
- Refactoring tasks: Backward compatibility, performance, regression testing

**Automated Checks:**
- File existence validation for mentioned components
- Test file presence verification
- Basic code structure validation
- Acceptance criteria completion tracking

**Manual Verification Process:**
- Code review checklist for complex implementations
- Integration testing verification
- Performance impact assessment
- Documentation completeness review

**Application Results:**
- Verified 26 completed tasks across the project
- Identified and resolved missing implementation notes for 5 tasks
- Fixed acceptance criteria status for 3 tasks
- Corrected implementation details for 2 tasks
- Reduced verification issues from 11 to 1 outstanding item

**Key Findings:**
- Most security and core functionality tasks properly implemented
- Some documentation tasks had mismatched implementation notes
- Test coverage generally good but some edge cases need attention
- One task (task-main-14) requires completion of implementation

**Recommendations:**
- Integrate verification script into CI pipeline
- Require implementation notes for all task completions
- Use checklist for manual verification of complex tasks
- Regular verification audits to maintain quality standards
