## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Integrate the repository pattern with dashboard statistics functionality to ensure proper abstraction layer usage throughout the application. This task ensures that all dashboard statistics operations go through the repository abstraction rather than directly accessing data sources.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Update DashboardStats model to work with repository pattern
- [x] #2 Modify dashboard routes to use EmailRepository instead of direct DataSource calls
- [x] #3 Ensure all dashboard aggregation methods use repository methods
- [x] #4 Update repository implementations to support all dashboard statistics operations
- [x] #5 Add caching layer to repository for dashboard statistics
- [ ] #6 Test repository pattern with dashboard statistics functionality
- [ ] #7 Verify performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] #8 Update all relevant documentation
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
This task bridges the repository pattern implementation with dashboard statistics functionality. The goal is to ensure complete abstraction layer usage throughout the application so that all data access goes through repositories rather than direct data source calls. This will improve testability, maintainability, and flexibility of the system.
