# Backlog Task: Post-Merge Validation and Cleanup

## Task ID: task-post-merge-validation-1

## Priority: Low

## Status: Not Started

## Description
This task involves validating that all changes have been successfully merged and cleaning up any remaining artifacts from the large branch alignment process.

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Validation
1. Verify all functionality from extracted PRs is working correctly
2. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
3. Test key user workflows to ensure end-to-end functionality
4. Validate performance has not been negatively impacted

### Part 2: Branch Cleanup
1. Delete merged branches from local and remote repositories
2. Archive any branches that were partially used but not fully merged
3. Update documentation to reflect any changes in process or architecture

#### Testing Branch Cleanup Completed:
- Deleted `refactor/python-nlp-testing` (merged)
- Deleted `test-coverage-improvement` (merged) 
- Deleted `bugfix/backend-fixes-and-test-suite-stabilization` (changes already incorporated into scientific branch)

### Part 3: Documentation Updates
1. Update project documentation to reflect merged changes
2. Add any new processes or guidelines that emerged during the alignment process
3. Ensure README and other key documentation is up to date

### Part 4: Retrospective
1. Document lessons learned from the branch alignment process
2. Identify what worked well and what could be improved
3. Update development processes to prevent similar issues in the future
4. Share findings with the team
