## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Refactor the core database implementation to eliminate global state management, singleton patterns, and hidden side effects. Implement proper dependency injection and optimize search performance.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Global state management eliminated
- [ ] #2 Singleton patterns removed
- [ ] #3 Hidden side effects from initialization removed
- [ ] #4 Dependency injection properly implemented
- [ ] #5 Data directory configurable via environment variables
- [ ] #6 Lazy loading strategy implemented and predictable
- [ ] #7 Search performance optimized to avoid disk I/O
- [ ] #8 Search indexing implemented
- [ ] #9 Search result caching supported
- [ ] #10 All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] #11 Performance benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] #12 Comprehensive test coverage achieved
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Design dependency injection framework for database manager
2. Replace global state access with injected dependencies
3. Update all modules that currently access database globally
4. Implement proper initialization without side effects
5. Identify all singleton usage in database implementation
6. Replace with injectable instances
7. Update factory patterns and initialization logic
8. Ensure thread safety in new implementation
9. Add environment variable support for data directory configuration
10. Implement fallback mechanisms for configuration values
11. Update documentation for new configuration options
12. Analyze current search performance bottlenecks
13. Implement in-memory search optimization to avoid disk I/O
14. Design and implement search indexing mechanism
15. Add configurable search result caching
16. Create comprehensive tests for refactored database functionality
17. Verify performance improvements with benchmarking
18. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code
19. Test edge cases and error conditions

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
This is a foundational refactoring that will improve maintainability and testability. Performance optimizations should be measured against current implementation. Backward compatibility is essential during transition. Consider implementing changes incrementally to reduce risk.
