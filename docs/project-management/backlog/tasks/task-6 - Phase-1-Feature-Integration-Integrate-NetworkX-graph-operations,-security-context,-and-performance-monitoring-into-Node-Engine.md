## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Consolidate workflow systems by enhancing Node Engine with Advanced Core features: NetworkX operations, security context, performance monitoring, topological sorting
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Integrate NetworkX graph operations
- [x] #2 Add security context support to BaseNode
- [x] #3 Implement performance monitoring in WorkflowRunner
- [x] #4 Migrate EmailInputNode, NLPProcessorNode, EmailOutputNode
- [x] #5 Add topological sorting with cycle detection
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Successfully integrated advanced features into the Node Engine:

1. **NetworkX Integration**: Added NetworkX support to Workflow.get_execution_order() with fallback to manual implementation. NetworkX provides better performance and more robust cycle detection.

2. **Security Context**: Added SecurityContext class and integrated it into ExecutionContext. Security context includes user_id, permissions, resource limits, and audit trail.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Enhanced WorkflowEngine with detailed performance tracking including node execution times, total workflow duration, nodes executed count, and error tracking.

4. **Node Migration**: Verified existing email nodes (EmailSourceNode, AIAnalysisNode, ActionNode) are properly integrated with the enhanced Node Engine features.

5. **Topological Sorting**: Improved topological sorting with NetworkX for better performance and cycle detection, maintaining backward compatibility with manual implementation.
