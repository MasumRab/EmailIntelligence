## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement background job processing for computationally expensive dashboard calculations like weekly growth analysis and performance metrics aggregation to improve API response times
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Choose background job framework (Celery, RQ, or asyncio-based)
- [ ] #2 Implement job queue for weekly growth calculations
- [ ] #3 Add background processing for performance metrics aggregation
- [ ] #4 Create job status tracking and results caching
- [ ] #5 Add job retry logic and error handling
- [ ] #6 Update dashboard API to handle async job results
- [ ] #7 Add job monitoring and queue management
