## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement comprehensive security features including RBAC policies, rate limiting, node validation, content sanitization, and execution sandboxing. Enhance existing security mechanisms with dynamic policies and configurable options.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Design RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system
2. Implement role definitions and permission mappings
3. Add rate limiting functionality for different user roles
4. Implement rate limiting for different node types
5. Design comprehensive node validation framework
6. Implement static analysis for config parameters
7. Create validation rules for different node types
8. Add validation error handling and reporting
9. Implement dynamic security policies based on user context
10. Enhance content sanitization to support Markdown and other content types
11. Add configurable sanitization policies based on security levels
12. Test sanitization with various content types
13. Design execution sandboxing architecture
14. Implement resource isolation mechanisms
15. Create custom execution environments based on security levels
16. Test sandboxing with various node types
17. Integrate all security features with existing system
18. Create comprehensive security tests
19. Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
20. Document security features and usage guidelines

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Security implementation should follow industry best practices. Consider OWASP guidelines for security implementation. Performance impact of security features should be minimized. All security features should be configurable and optional where appropriate. Regular security audits should be planned after implementation.
