## Task ID: task-create-docs-pr-1

## Priority: Low

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that extracts documentation improvements from the `fix/import-errors-and-docs` branch. This PR should address specific documentation issues without including import fixes or other unrelated changes.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `fix/import-errors-and-docs`
- Create new branch: `docs/improved-documentation`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. README updates and clarifications
2. API documentation improvements
3. Setup and configuration guides
4. Code comments and inline documentation
5. Architecture documentation updates

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `fix/import-errors-and-docs` branch for documentation commits
2. Check if these improvements already exist in scientific branch
3. Identify the specific documentation issues being addressed
4. Document the problems with current documentation

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `docs/improved-documentation` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the documentation improvements
3. Ensure changes maintain consistency with existing documentation style
4. Add comprehensive documentation for any new features or changes

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the documentation improvements
2. Document which areas of documentation were improved
3. Include verification instructions for documentation quality
4. Add notes about any new documentation sections

### Part 4: Testing
1. Verify documentation builds correctly
2. Check for broken links or formatting issues
3. Ensure all documentation examples work as expected
4. Run any documentation validation tools
