# Backlog Task: Create PR for Import Error Fixes

## Task ID: task-create-import-fixes-pr-1

## Priority: Medium

## Status: Not Started

## Description
Create a focused PR that extracts import error fixes from the `fix/import-errors-and-docs` branch. This PR should address specific import/circular dependency issues without including documentation changes.

## Target Branch
- Extract from: `fix/import-errors-and-docs`
- Create new branch: `fix/import-error-corrections`

## Specific Changes to Include
1. Resolution of circular import issues
2. Correct import path fixes
3. Module dependency organization improvements
4. Package structure clarifications

## Action Plan

### Part 1: Analysis
1. Review `fix/import-errors-and-docs` branch for import-related commits
2. Check if these fixes already exist in scientific branch
3. Identify the specific import issues being addressed
4. Document the problems with current import structure

### Part 2: Implementation
1. Create new branch `fix/import-error-corrections` from current scientific
2. Cherry-pick or reimplement only the import fixes
3. Ensure changes maintain correct module dependencies
4. Add tests for import behavior if needed

### Part 3: Documentation
1. Write clear PR description explaining the import issues
2. Document how the fixes address each issue
3. Include verification instructions for import behavior
4. Add notes about any import path changes

### Part 4: Testing
1. Run import-focused tests to ensure correct behavior
2. Verify no regressions in existing functionality
3. Test all modules can be imported correctly
4. Ensure performance is not negatively impacted

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Import error fixes are extracted into focused PR
- [ ] PR addresses only import-related changes
- [ ] All import tests pass
- [ ] PR description is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] GitHub PR is created and ready for review

## Dependencies
- Current PRs (docs cleanup, search in category) should be merged first
- Clean scientific branch as baseline
- Security fixes PR should be prioritized first

## Estimated Effort
1 day: Analysis and identification
1-2 days: Implementation and testing
0.5 day: Documentation and PR creation

## Notes
- Focus only on import fixes, separate from documentation changes
- Test thoroughly with different import scenarios
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any changes to public API import paths
- Coordinate with team members who work with the affected modules
- Ensure all modules can be imported without errors
