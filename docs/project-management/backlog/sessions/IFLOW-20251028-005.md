- SQLite database
- Node-based workflow system

## Development Conventions
- Following project-specific code organization
- Using dependency injection over global state
- Adhering to security best practices
- Maintaining existing architectural patterns

## Session Activities
1. ✅ Created session tracking directory: `/backlog/sessions`
2. ✅ Created session tracking file: `IFLOW-20251028-005.md`
3. ✅ Integrated with IFLOW.md documentation
4. ✅ Established session goals and context

## Next Steps
1. Continue with development workflows as defined in IFLOW.md
2. Maintain proper session documentation throughout development
3. Follow iFlow CLI software engineering workflow:
   - Understand: Analyze requests and codebase context
   - Plan: Build coherent plans based on understanding
   - Implement: Use available tools to act on plans
   - Verify: Run tests and check code standards
