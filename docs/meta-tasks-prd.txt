# META Tasks Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement the critical META tasks identified in the research document "there-are-multiple-branchs-containing-attempts-and.md" to establish a robust framework for managing complex branch integrations, particularly for `feature-notmuch*` type branches with large shared histories. These META tasks are critical for ensuring proper prioritization and coordination of complex development workflows.

## User Stories

### User Story 1 - Implement META-01: Establish Robust Branch Integration Framework (Priority: P1) 🎯 Critical
Create and properly prioritize META-01 as a critical foundational task to orchestrate preparatory work and ongoing management necessary for smooth, conflict-minimized integration of significant feature branches into the `scientific` branch.

**Description**: META-01: Establish Robust Branch Integration Framework & Manage Concurrent Feature Development
**Priority**: Critical (This task should be prioritized above Task 8 and coordinated with Task 49)
**Requirements**:
- Accelerate and complete Task 20: Configure Branch Protection Rules and Merge Guards
- Finalize Task 21: Create Merge Best Practices Documentation
- Define Concurrent Development Strategy for `scientific`
- Establish Dedicated Integration Branch strategy
- Schedule Regular Conflict Review & Architectural Alignment Meetings

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- META-01 is created in the task management system with proper dependencies
- Task 20 (Branch Protection) is prioritized and completed
- Task 21 (Merge Best Practices) is prioritized and completed
- Concurrent development strategy is defined and implemented
- Dedicated integration branch strategy is established
- Regular conflict review meetings are scheduled and documented

### User Story 2 - Implement META-02: Finalize and Validate Notmuch Feature Set (Priority: P2)
Create and properly prioritize META-02 as a high-priority task to ensure all functionalities introduced by the `feature-notmuch-tagging-1` branch are fully combined, functional, and robust after integration.

**Description**: META-02: Finalize and Validate Notmuch Feature Set
**Priority**: High (Dependent on META-01 and successful completion of Task 8, and relevant parts of Task 43)
**Requirements**:
- Comprehensive End-to-End Testing of notmuch features
- Performance and Scalability Testing
- Documentation Updates
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Architectural Compliance Review

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- META-02 is created in the task management system with proper dependencies
- All notmuch feature testing completed successfully
- Performance benchmarks met for notmuch features
- Documentation updated to reflect notmuch integration
- Stakeholders complete UAT and approve notmuch features
- Architecture compliance verified for notmuch integration

### User Story 3 - Implement META-03: Strategic Integration of Notmuch Feature Branches (Priority: P3) 🎯 Critical
Create and properly prioritize META-03 as a critical task to manage the entire lifecycle of integrating `feature-notmuch*` branches, transforming individual integration events into a repeatable, controlled process.

**Description**: META-03: Strategic Integration of Notmuch Feature Branches
**Priority**: Critical (Dependent on META-01 completion)
**Requirements**:
- `feature-notmuch` Branch Assessment & Pre-Integration Planning
- Iterative Rebase & Conflict Resolution
- Architectural Review & Database Alignment with Task 43
- Incremental Feature Testing & Validation
- Final Merge into `scientific`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- META-03 is created in the task management system with proper dependencies
- Branch assessment and pre-integration planning completed
- Iterative rebase and conflict resolution process implemented
- Architectural review and database alignment with Task 43 completed
- Incremental feature testing validated
- Successful final merge into `scientific` branch

### User Story 4 - Verify Proper Dependencies and Prioritization (Priority: P4)
Ensure all META tasks have correct dependencies and prioritization as specified in the research document.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- META-01 dependencies properly set (no dependencies as a top-level coordination task)
- META-03 dependencies properly set (depends on META-01 completion)
- META-02 dependencies properly set (depends on META-01 and successful completion of Task 8)
- Prioritization correctly set: META-01 and META-03 as Critical, META-02 as High
- All referenced tasks (Task 8, Task 20, Task 21, Task 43, Task 49) properly linked

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Task management system access
- Project repository access
- Documentation and planning tools

### Quality Standards
- All META tasks properly documented in the system
- Dependencies accurately defined and implemented
- Prioritization correctly applied
- Clear subtasks defined for each META task
- Traceability established between research document and implement tasks

### Testing Requirements
- Verification that META tasks exist in the task management system
- Confirmation of correct priority levels
- Validation of dependency relationships
- Review by project stakeholders

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: META Task Creation
- Create META-01 in task management system with critical priority
- Create META-02 in task management system with high priority
- Create META-03 in task management system with critical priority
- Define all subtasks for each META task based on research document

### Phase 2: Dependency and Priority Configuration
- Set dependencies for each META task as specified in research
- Apply correct priority levels to each META task
- Link related tasks (Task 8, Task 20, Task 21, Task 43, Task 49) to appropriate META tasks
- Document all relationships and dependencies clearly

### Phase 3: Validation and Review
- Validate that all META tasks are properly configured
- Confirm correct prioritization and dependencies
- Review with project stakeholders
- Make any necessary adjustments based on feedback

## Success Criteria
- All three META tasks created in the task management system
- META-01 and META-03 properly prioritized as Critical
- META-02 properly prioritized as High
- All dependencies correctly established
- Research-identified requirements implemented
- Stakeholder approval obtained for META task implementation
- Clear path forward established for complex branch integrations

## Dependencies
- Access to task management system
- Project stakeholders for review and approval
- Research document: "there-are-multiple-branchs-containing-attempts-and.md"
- Task 8: Integrate `feature-notmuch-tagging-1` into `scientific` with Architecture Alignment
- Task 20: Configure Branch Protection Rules and Merge Guards
- Task 21: Create Merge Best Practices Documentation
- Task 43: Database Refactoring for Dependency Injection & Global State Elimination
- Task 49: Implement Multi-Tenant Dashboard Support (Scientific Branch)

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Insufficient prioritization of META tasks - Mitigation: Clear documentation of critical nature
- Risk: Incomplete dependency mapping - Mitigation: Thorough review and validation
- Risk: Misalignment with research requirements - Mitigation: Direct mapping to research document
- Risk: Stakeholder disagreement on priorities - Mitigation: Clear communication of rationale

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Create all META tasks in the system
- Phase 2: Configure dependencies and priorities correctly
- Phase 3: Validate implementation and obtain stakeholder approval
