# Prompt Analysis and Improvement

## Original Prompt
```
from the chat context construct the best plan to implement improvemnts to the @tasks/ md files
```

## Evaluation Analysis

### 1. Clarity & Specificity
**Current State:**
- The prompt is unclear and ambiguous
- "construct the best plan" is vague without specific criteria
- "improvemnts" contains a typo
- "@tasks/" is unclear notation (likely refers to a directory)
- No specific objectives or requirements defined

### 2. Structure & Organization
**Current State:**
- No structure or organization
- No headers, sections, or logical flow
- Single unstructured sentence

### 3. Context & Constraints
**Current State:**
- No context provided about what the @tasks/ md files contain
- No constraints or boundaries defined
- No assumptions stated

### 4. Output Specification
**Current State:**
- No output format specified
- No examples provided
- No level of detail specified

# Task Markdown Files Improvement Plan

## Objective
Analyze the existing markdown files in the ./tasks/ directory and create a comprehensive improvement plan that enhances their structure, content, and usability.

## Context
The ./tasks/ directory contains markdown files that document various tasks. These files need to be improved to follow consistent standards, enhance readability, and provide better guidance for task implementation.

## Requirements

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Review all markdown files in the ./tasks/ directory
- Identify current structure, formatting, and content patterns
- Document inconsistencies and areas for improvement
- Assess the current state of task documentation

### 2. Improvement Areas to Address
- **Standardization**: Ensure consistent formatting and structure across all files
- **Completeness**: Verify all necessary sections are present (description, steps, dependencies, success criteria)
- **Readability**: Improve clarity, formatting, and organization
- **Maintainability**: Add versioning, metadata, and update guidelines
- **Usability**: Enhance navigation, cross-references, and linking

### 3. Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing content
- Follow markdown best practices
- Ensure changes are implementable in a reasonable timeframe
- Preserve important historical information

## Deliverables

### 1. Current State Assessment
- Inventory of all task markdown files
- Summary of current structure and content
- List of identified issues and inconsistencies

### 2. Improvement Plan
- Prioritized list of improvements to implement
- Recommended standard format for task markdown files
- Implementation timeline and approach
- Resource requirements and dependencies

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Step-by-step instructions for applying improvements
- Templates or examples for new standard format
- Quality assurance checklist
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Output Format
Provide your analysis and plan in the following structured format:

### Current State Assessment
- File count and naming patterns
- Structure analysis
- Issues identified

### Recommended Improvements
- High priority (critical issues)
- Medium priority (important enhancements)
- Low priority (nice-to-have improvements)

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Critical fixes
- Phase 2: Structural improvements
- Phase 3: Enhancement and optimization

### Success Criteria
- How to measure improvement success
- Quality metrics to track
- Validation methods
```
