### Implementation

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/merge-validation.yml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install pytest pytest-cov
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest src/ --cov --cov-report=xml --tb=short
