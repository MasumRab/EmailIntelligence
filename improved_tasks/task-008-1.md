# Task 009.1: Define Validation Scope and Tooling

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** high
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity:** 5/10
**Dependencies:** None
**Description:** Research and document validation tools for each layer


**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Parent:** Task 009: Create Comprehensive Merge Validation Framework

---

## Purpose
## Prerequisites & Dependencies

### Required Before Starting
- [ ] No external dependencies

### Blocks (What This Task Unblocks)
- [ ] None specified



Define validation layers and select appropriate tools for the merge validation framework.

---

## Details

Research and document validation tools for each layer.

### Validation Layers

| Layer | Tools | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Architectural | ruff, flake8, mypy | Static analysis |
| Functional | pytest | Unit/integration tests |
| Performance | locust, pytest-benchmark | Benchmarking |
| Security | bandit, safety | SAST, dependency scan |

### Output

Create `validation_framework_design.md` with:
- Tool selection rationale
- Configuration requirements
- Expected output formats
- Threshold definitions

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Tools selected for all layers
- [ ] Configuration documented
- [ ] Thresholds defined
- [ ] Design document complete

---

## Implementation Notes

### Tool Selection Criteria

```markdown
## Architectural Enforcement
- ruff: Fast, modern Python linter
- flake8: Established, extensible
- mypy: Type checking

## Functional Correctness
- pytest: Full test framework
- Coverage: 90%+ required

## Performance
- locust: Load testing
- pytest-benchmark: Unit benchmarks

## Security
- bandit: SAST
- safety: Dependency scanning
```
