       with open(filepath) as f:
           tree = ast.parse(f.read())
       
       for node in ast.walk(tree):
           if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
               for alias in node.names:
                   if not module_exists(alias.name):
                       yield f"Missing module: {alias.name}"
           
           elif isinstance(node, ast.ImportFrom):
               if node.module:
                   if not module_exists(node.module):
                       yield f"Missing module: {node.module}"
   ```

3. **Validate backend→src migration**
   - Check for 'backend' imports
   - Suggest correct 'src' paths

4. **Create comprehensive report**
   - All errors grouped by type
   - Suggested fixes

5. **Ensure safe execution**]

   - Public/shared branches
   - Audit trail importance

2. **Document when to use rebase**
   - Clean linear history desired
   - Small team or solo work
   - Private feature branches
   - Before squash merge

3. **Define strategy per branch type**

   - Long-running branches → merge
   - Documentation → rebase
   - Core changes → evaluate case-by-case

4. **Document conflict resolution procedures**
   - Interactive rebase workflow
   - Merge conflict handling
   - Visual merge tool integration

5. **Specify when to use visual merge tools**
   - Complex multi-file conflicts

- **Inputs**: [What it needs - 003.1]
- **Outputs**: [What it produces - UNKNOWN: Untitled Task]
- **Behavior**: [Key logic - Create `scripts/validate_critical_files.py` that validates all critical files according to criteria from 003.1.

### Steps

1. **Create script structure**
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   import argparse
   import json
   import os
   from pathlib import Path
   ```

2. **Implement validation functions**
   - `check_exists(file_path)` - File exists
   - `check_not_empty(file_path)` - File has content
   - `check_json_valid(file_path)` - Valid JSON

3. **Load critical file configuration**

4. **Execute validation**

5. **Return exit codes**
   - 0: All checks pass
   - 1: One or more checks fail

6. **Log detailed errors**]

### Capability: UNKNOWN: Untitled Task
[Brief description of what this capability domain covers: Analyze Git history and codebase structure for each branch to support target determination.]

#### Feature: UNKNOWN: Untitled Task
- **Description**: Analyze Git history and codebase structure for each branch to support target determination.
- **Inputs**: [What it needs - 001.1]
- **Outputs**: [What it produces - UNKNOWN: Untitled Task]
- **Behavior**: [Key logic - This subtask performs detailed analysis of each active feature branch, examining commit history patterns and codebase structure to inform integration target selection.

### Steps

1. **Extract Git history for each branch**
   ```bash
   for branch in $(cat active_branches.txt); do
     echo "=== $branch ==="
     git log --oneline --since="1 year ago" origin/$branch
     git log --format="%H %ai %an" origin/$branch | head -5
   done
   ```

2. **Calculate shared commits with primary targets**
   ```bash
   # Find merge base between feature branch and each primary branch
   git merge-base origin/feature-branch origin/main
   git merge-base origin/feature-branch origin/scientific
   git merge-base origin/feature-branch origin/orchestration-tools
   ```

3. **Analyze file-level codebase similarity**
   ```bash
   # Compare file structures
   git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/$branch | sort > branch_files.txt
   git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main | sort > main_files.txt
   diff branch_files.txt main_files.txt
   ```

4. **Assess architectural alignment**
   - Identify modified directories
   - Detect changes to core modules
   - Map imports and dependencies
   - Evaluate architectural patterns

5. **Document findings for each branch**]

   - Supporting evidence
   - Alternative considered and rejected
   - Any concerns or risks

4. **Identify branches needing renaming**
   - Ambiguous names (feature-scientific-X targeting main)
