error: Distribution `markupsafe==3.0.2 @ registry+https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` can't be installed because it doesn't have a source distribution or wheel for the current platform

hint: You're using CPython 3.12 (`cp312`), but `markupsafe` (v3.0.2) only has wheels with the following Python implementation tag: `cp313`
