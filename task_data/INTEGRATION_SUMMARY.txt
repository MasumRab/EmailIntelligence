   - Shows Test Case Examples section
   - Shows Technical Reference appendix
   - Key changes table
   - Developer experience comparison

3. HANDOFF_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md (4,000+ words)
   - Step-by-step integration instructions
   - Per-task integration checklist (for all 9 tasks)
   - Content mapping guide
   - Integration command reference
   - Timeline and pace recommendations
   - Quality checks
   - Success criteria
   - Post-integration maintenance

PLUS: PROJECT_STATE_CHECKLIST.md already created earlier

================================================================================
HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS
================================================================================

FOR PLANNING:
1. Read INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md to understand the approach
2. Read INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md to see what final result looks like
3. Use HANDOFF_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md as step-by-step guide

FOR EXECUTION:
1. Use HANDOFF_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md as your working guide
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions per task
3. Use the content mapping table to know what goes where
4. Refer to INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md if you need to see the pattern

FOR VALIDATION:
1. Use Quality Checks from HANDOFF_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
2. Verify success criteria are met
3. Validate each of 9 tasks completes the checklist

================================================================================
INTEGRATION OVERVIEW
================================================================================

What to extract from HANDOFF files:

A. Quick Summary / What to Build (5-10 lines)
   → Goes into "Developer Quick Reference" section after Purpose

B. Class/Function Signature (code block)
   → Goes into "Developer Quick Reference"

C. Implementation Checklist (bulleted list)
   → Goes into EACH subtask (after Success Criteria)

D. Test Cases (5-8 concrete examples)
   → Goes into testing subtask (after Success Criteria)
   → Renamed to "Test Case Examples (From HANDOFF)"

E. Git Commands, Code Patterns, Dependencies
   → Goes into "Technical Reference (From HANDOFF)" appendix

================================================================================
SECTION PLACEMENT IN TASK FILES
================================================================================

Task File Structure (Integrated):

# Task 75.X: [Name]

## Purpose
[Original purpose]

## Developer Quick Reference                    ← NEW (from HANDOFF)
  - What to build
  - Class signature
  - Key metrics

## Success Criteria
[Original criteria]

## Subtasks

### 75.X.Y: [Subtask Name]
[Original spec]

### Implementation Checklist (From HANDOFF)     ← NEW per subtask
  - Practical steps
  - Git commands
  - Error handling

[... more subtasks ...]

### 75.X.Z: [Testing Subtask]
[Original spec]

### Test Case Examples (From HANDOFF)           ← NEW for testing
  - 5-8 concrete test cases
  - Expected inputs/outputs
  - Edge cases

## Configuration Parameters
[Original configuration]

## Technical Reference (From HANDOFF)           ← NEW appendix
  - Git Commands Reference

================================================================================
SIZE EXPECTATIONS
================================================================================

Current:
  - task-75.X.md: 250-280 lines (specification only)
  - HANDOFF_75.X.md: 130-150 lines (implementation guide only)
  - Total when using both: 380-430 lines (but split into 2 files)

After Integration:
  - task-75.X.md: 380-430 lines (integrated)
  - HANDOFF_75.X.md: Remains available as optional reference
  - Single file has everything needed

Impact: +100-150 lines of practical guidance embedded in task files

================================================================================
TIMELINE
================================================================================

Per Task:
  - Read HANDOFF: 10 min
  - Extract sections: 10 min
  - Insert and format: 15 min
  - Review and validate: 10 min
  - Total: ~45 minutes per task

All 9 Tasks:
  - Total time: 6-7 hours
  - Can be done in 2-3 days at 2-3 hours/day
  - Or completed in one focused session

Recommended Pace:
  - Day 1: Tasks 75.1-75.3 (2.25 hours)
  - Day 2: Tasks 75.4-75.6 (2.25 hours)  
  - Day 3: Tasks 75.7-75.9 (2.25 hours)

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

Integration complete when:

✓ All 9 task files have Developer Quick Reference
✓ All 72+ subtasks have Implementation Checklist section
✓ All 9 testing subtasks have Test Case Examples
✓ All 9 files have Technical Reference appendix
✓ Files sized appropriately (350-450 lines each)
✓ No critical content missing from either source
✓ All formatting clean and consistent
✓ Developers can work from task file alone
✓ HANDOFF files remain available as backup reference
✓ Content synchronized across both files

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md (understand the approach)
2. Review INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md (see the pattern)
3. Follow HANDOFF_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md (execute the integration)
4. Apply to all 9 tasks (75.1 through 75.9)
5. Validate using provided quality checks
6. Verify success criteria

================================================================================
KEY PRINCIPLE
================================================================================

HANDOFF files provide valuable implementation guidance. Rather than keeping
them separate, integrate key sections into task files at the points where
developers need them:

- Quick summary → After Purpose (for context)
- Implementation steps → After each subtask spec (for how to do it)
- Test examples → In testing subtask (for what to test)
- Technical reference → Appendix (for commands and patterns)

Result: Single task file = complete specification + implementation guidance
        Developers don't need to flip between files
        HANDOFF files remain available for those who prefer them
