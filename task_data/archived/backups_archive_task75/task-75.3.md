## Metrics to Compute

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `code_churn` | 30% | Lines changed ratio (inverse) |
| `change_concentration` | 25% | Files affected count (lower = higher) |
| `diff_complexity` | 25% | Large diffs in few files |
| `integration_risk` | 20% | Pattern-based risk scoring |

All metrics normalized to [0, 1].

- [ ] Handles binary files
- [ ] Performance: <2 seconds per extraction

---

### 75.3.3: Implement Code Churn Metric
**Purpose:** Score lines changed ratio (lower = higher)  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Steps:**
1. Calculate total changes (added + deleted)
2. Estimate codebase size
3. Calculate churn ratio
4. Invert to score (lower churn = higher)
5. Cap at 1.0 and normalize

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Returns value in [0, 1] range
- [ ] Minimal churn scores > 0.8
- [ ] High churn scores < 0.3
- [ ] Handles edge cases (empty repos)

---

### 75.3.4: Implement Change Concentration Metric
**Purpose:** Score files affected count  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Steps:**
1. Count unique files changed
2. Normalize by reasonable max (e.g., 50)
3. Invert (fewer files = higher score)
4. Return concentration score
5. Test with various file counts

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Returns value in [0, 1] range
- [ ] Single file changes score > 0.9
- [ ] Many files score lower
- [ ] Handles 0-file case

---

### 75.3.5: Implement Diff Complexity Metric
**Purpose:** Score complexity (large changes in few files)  
**Effort:** 3-4 hours

**Steps:**
1. Identify largest file change
2. Calculate average change per file
3. Compute concentration ratio
4. Score complexity (high ratio = complex)
5. Cap at 1.0

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Returns value in [0, 1] range
- [ ] Concentrated changes score higher
- [ ] Scattered changes score lower
- [ ] Handles single-file diffs

## Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Get diff stats (additions/deletions per file)
git diff main...BRANCH_NAME --numstat

# Get unified diff with context
git diff main...BRANCH_NAME

# Get file-level change summary
git diff main...BRANCH_NAME --compact-summary

# Count lines in specific file
git show BRANCH_NAME:path/to/file | wc -l
```

## Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Binary files**: Ignore in line counts
2. **Large diffs**: Cap metrics at 1.0
3. **Deleted files**: Count as deletions
4. **Merge commits**: Use `...` in git diff
5. **No diff**: Return all metrics as 0.5
