# Security Audit Report

This document summarizes the findings from the security audit performed on [Date].

## Automated Security Scans

### Bandit Scan

The `bandit` scan identified a number of security vulnerabilities in the Python code. The full report can be generated by running `bandit -r src`.

**High-Severity Issues:**

*   **Use of `exec`:** The `exec` function is used in `src/core/plugin_base.py`. This has been mitigated by using the `RestrictedPython` library.
*   **Hardcoded Passwords:** A possible hardcoded password was found in `src/core/audit_logger.py`. This has been identified as a false positive and suppressed with a `#nosec` comment.
*   **Use of weak MD5 hash:** The `hashlib.md5` function is used in `src/backend/python_nlp/data_strategy.py` and `src/backend/python_nlp/gmail_integration.py`. This has been replaced with `hashlib.sha256`.

**Medium-Severity Issues:**

*   **Unsafe Hugging Face Hub download:** The `from_pretrained` function is used without a revision pin in `src/core/model_registry.py`.
*   **URL open for permitted schemes:** The `urlopen` function is used in `src/core/plugin_manager.py`.

**Low-Severity Issues:**

*   A large number of low-severity issues were identified, mostly related to the use of `assert` in tests.

### Safety Scan

The `safety` scan identified 15 vulnerabilities in the installed dependencies. The full report can be generated by running `safety check`.

**Vulnerable Packages:**

*   `gradio`
*   `urllib3`
*   `notebook`
*   `setuptools`
*   `requests`
*   `certifi`
*   `jupyterlab`
*   `idna`

## Recommendations

It is recommended to address the medium-severity issues identified by the `bandit` scan as a priority. The vulnerabilities identified by the `safety` scan should also be addressed by updating the affected dependencies.
