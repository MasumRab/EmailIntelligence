# DEPRECATED: EmailIntelligence Extensions

**This directory is part of the deprecated `backend` package and will be removed in a future release.**

This directory contains extensions for the EmailIntelligence application, allowing for modular enhancements.

For detailed information on using existing extensions, developing new ones, the extension lifecycle, and the extension API, please see the **[Extensions Guide](../../docs/extensions_guide.md)**.

To manage extensions (list, install, create, etc.), you can use the main launcher script. Refer to the **[Launcher Guide](../../docs/launcher_guide.md#extensions-and-models)** for commands.
