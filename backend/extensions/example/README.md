This extension demonstrates the extension system by adding a simple sentiment analysis enhancement to the EmailIntelligence application.

## Features

- Adds detailed metrics to sentiment analysis results:
  - Word count

2. Restart the EmailIntelligence application.

## Usage

### API

The extension also provides utility functions that can be used directly:

# Get an emoji for a sentiment
emoji = get_sentiment_emoji("positive")  # Returns "üòä"

# Analyze text with emojis
result = analyze_text_with_emojis("I love this application!")
# Returns:
# {
#     "text": "I love this application!",
#     "word_count": 4,
#     "character_count": 24,
#     "exclamation_count": 1,

# }
```
